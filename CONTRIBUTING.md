## Reporting Classification Errors

The AI analysis may contain errors. Your feedback helps improve data quality!

### Types of Classification Issues

1. **False Positive**: Text marked as figurative but is literal
2. **False Negative**: Figurative language not detected
3. **Wrong Type**: Classified as wrong figurative type (e.g., marked as metaphor but is actually a simile)
4. **Incorrect Metadata**: Wrong Target/Vehicle/Ground/Posture classification

### What to Include

When reporting classification issues, please provide:

```markdown
**Verse Reference**: Genesis 1:2

**Current Classification**: Metaphor

**Issue Type**: False Positive / False Negative / Wrong Type / Incorrect Metadata

**Explanation**:
[Explain why you believe the current classification is incorrect]

**Suggested Classification**:
[What should it be instead?]

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Biblical commentaries
- Hebrew grammar references
- Scholarly sources
- Linguistic analysis

**Hebrew Text**: [if relevant to your argument]

**English Translation**: [if relevant]
```

### Scholarly Standards

We appreciate contributions that reference:
- Traditional biblical commentaries (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, etc.)
- Modern scholarly works
- Hebrew grammar references
- Linguistic analysis

**Note**: We value diverse scholarly perspectives. You don't need to be an expert‚Äîthoughtful observations are welcome!
