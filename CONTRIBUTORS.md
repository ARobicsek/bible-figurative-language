## AI Tools

This project leveraged advanced AI models for text analysis:

### Google Gemini
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Primary model for figurative language detection and validation (~95% of verses)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Fallback model for complex passages requiring extended context

### Anthropic Claude
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Final fallback model for extremely complex passages and project development assistance

**Note:** All AI-generated classifications are transparently documented in the database with full deliberation records.
