And it shall remain an everlasting ruin, never to be rebuilt.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	architectural	0.85	an everlasting ruin	תֵּ֣ל עוֹלָ֔ם	The city is metaphorically described as a 'heap' or 'ruin' that will last forever, emphasizing its complete and permanent destruction. The term 'everlasting ruin' transcends a simple description of physical destruction and conveys a sense of utter hopelessness and divine judgment.
945	Deuteronomy 34:4	Deuteronomy	וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלָ֗יו זֹ֤את הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִ֠שְׁבַּ֠עְתִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לְזַרְעֲךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶ֑נָּה הֶרְאִיתִ֣יךָ בְעֵינֶ֔יךָ וְשָׁ֖מָּה לֹ֥א תַעֲבֹֽר	And יהוה said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ‘I will assign it to your offspring.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you shall not cross there.”	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	covenantal	0.85	This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob	זֹאת הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁבַּ֠עְתִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙	The land itself is used metaphorically to represent the promise and covenant God made with the patriarchs.

795	Deuteronomy 29:13	Deuteronomy	וְלֹ֥א אִתְּכֶ֖ם לְבַדְּכֶ֑ם אָנֹכִ֗י כֹּרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת	I make this covenant, with its sanctions, not with you alone,	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	covenantal	0.8	I make this covenant	כֹרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את	The act of 'cutting' a covenant is a metaphor.

The emphasis is on the irrevocable and binding nature of the covenant.
795	Deuteronomy 29:13	Deuteronomy	וְלֹ֥א אִתְּכֶ֖ם לְבַדְּכֶ֑ם אָנֹכִ֗י כֹּרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת	I make this covenant, with its sanctions, not with you alone,	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	covenantal	0.75	with its sanctions	וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת	The term "ālā" (אָלָה) literally means "curse" or "oath," but in this context, it functions metaphorically to represent the consequences or penalties associated with breaking the covenant. It's not simply a statement of punishment, but a figurative representation of the weight and repercussions of covenant violation.
760	Deuteronomy 28:46	Deuteronomy	וְהָי֣וּ בְךָ֔ לְא֖וֹת וּלְמוֹפֵ֑ת וּֽבְזַרְעֲךָ֖ עַד־עוֹלָֽם	They shall serve as signs and proofs against you and your offspring for all time.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	covenantal	0.8	signs and proofs	לְא֖וֹת וּלְמוֹפֵ֑ת	The actions/events described (implied in the context) are presented as visible signs and demonstrable proofs of divine judgment, functioning as a metaphor for the tangible consequences of disobedience.

The phrasing of vv. 12, 18 conspicuously omits mention of the householder’s (primary) wife. This means that she is authorized to carry out such activity in case her husband is unavailable. The wording also tacitly includes the case of a woman (typically a widow) whose household is not headed by a man. Cf. 5.14 and note at 5.6; see further the Dictionary under “house.” you shall feast there before your God יהוה, happy in all the undertakings in which your God יהוה has blessed you.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	economic	0.75	happy in all the undertakings in which	וּשְׂמַחְתֶּ֗ם בְּכֹל֙ מִשְׁלַ֣ח יֶדְכֶ֔ם	The phrase 'undertakings of your hands' is a metonym for the fruits of one's labor.

The phrase highlights the shocking extent of the man's cruelty, extending even to his closest companion.
659	Deuteronomy 25:9	Deuteronomy	וְנִגְּשָׁ֨ה יְבִמְתּ֣וֹ אֵלָיו֮ לְעֵינֵ֣י הַזְּקֵנִים֒ וְחָלְצָ֤ה נַעֲלוֹ֙ מֵעַ֣ל רַגְל֔וֹ וְיָרְקָ֖ה בְּפָנָ֑יו וְעָֽנְתָה֙ וְאָ֣מְרָ֔ה כָּ֚כָה יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה לָאִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יִבְנֶ֖ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית אָחִֽיו	his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, pull the sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and make this declaration: Thus shall be done to the man*man Lit. “participant whose involvement defines the depicted situation.” See the Dictionary under ’ish. who will not build up his brother’s house!	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	familial	0.85	pull the sandal off his foot	חָלְצָ֤ה נַעֲלוֹ֙ מֵעַ֣ל רַגְל֔וֹ	The act of removing a sandal is a legal act signifying relinquishment of rights and responsibilities, here metaphorically representing the relinquishment of the brother's responsibility to provide for his brother's widow and continue his family line.

For you are a people consecrated to your God יהוה. You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	familial	0.75	You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk	לֹֽא־תְבַשֵּׁ֥ל גְּדִ֖י בַּחֲלֵ֥ב אִמּֽוֹ	This prohibition, while literal in its instruction, functions metaphorically as a symbolic representation of the broader principle of maintaining natural order and avoiding unnatural or cruel practices.

It reduces the idol from a divine object to a simple human creation, highlighting its lack of inherent divinity.
675	Deuteronomy 26:6	Deuteronomy	וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ וַיִּתְּנ֥וּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ עֲבֹדָ֥ה קָשָֽׁה	The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	industrial	0.75	heavy labor	עֲבֹדָ֥ה קָשָֽׁה	While "עֲבֹדָה קָשָֽׁה" (avodah qashah) literally translates to "heavy labor," the term functions metaphorically in the context of the narrative. The "heaviness" transcends the physical exertion; it represents the crushing weight of oppression, the dehumanizing nature of the forced labor, and the symbolic burden of slavery. It's not just about the physical difficulty but the oppressive system itself.

101	Deuteronomy 3:18	Deuteronomy	וָאֲצַ֣ו אֶתְכֶ֔ם בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִ֖וא לֵאמֹ֑ר יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֗ם נָתַ֨ן לָכֶ֜ם אֶת־הָאָ֤רֶץ הַזֹּאת֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ חֲלוּצִ֣ים תַּֽעַבְר֗וּ לִפְנֵ֛י אֲחֵיכֶ֥ם בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל כׇּל־בְּנֵי־חָֽיִל	At that time I charged you [men of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh], saying, “Your God יהוה has given you this country to possess.

218	Deuteronomy 7:2	Deuteronomy	וּנְתָנָ֞ם יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ לְפָנֶ֖יךָ וְהִכִּיתָ֑ם הַחֲרֵ֤ם תַּחֲרִים֙ אֹתָ֔ם לֹא־תִכְרֹ֥ת לָהֶ֛ם בְּרִ֖ית וְלֹ֥א תְחׇנֵּֽם	and your God יהוה delivers them to you and you defeat them, you must doom them to destruction: grant them no terms and give them no quarter.	metaphor		Human Institutions and Relationships	military	0.8	and you defeat them	וְהִכִּיתָם	The verb "הִכִּיתָם" (to defeat) is used metaphorically to represent the complete and utter subjugation of the enemy, going beyond a simple military victory to encompass their total destruction as commanded by God.
