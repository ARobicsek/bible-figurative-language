## Why Dual License?

We use separate licenses for code and data because:

1. **Code** (MIT): Permissive license encouraging wide reuse and integration with other projects
2. **Data** (CC BY 4.0): Specifically designed for creative works and datasets, ensuring proper attribution while allowing maximum reuse

This approach is common in academic and research projects that combine software and data.
