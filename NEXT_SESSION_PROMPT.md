# Next Session: UI Tweaks and Improvements

## Context
We're working on **Tzafun** (https://tzafun.onrender.com), a biblical figurative language concordance with 8,373 analyzed verses (Torah + Psalms) and 5,933 figurative language instances.

**Recent Success (Oct 1, 2025)**:
- âœ… **Hebrew Highlighting Bug FIXED!** - All verses with maqaf (Ö¾) hyphens now highlight correctly
- âœ… **Performance Optimizations** - Achieved 100-1300x speedup through database indexes and query caching
- âœ… **System Stable** - Production deployment running smoothly on free tier (512MB RAM)

## Current Task: Minor UI Tweaks

The system is working great! Now we want to polish the user interface with minor improvements and refinements.

### Potential Areas for UI Enhancement

You and the user will discuss which UI improvements to make. Here are some areas to consider:

#### Visual/Styling Tweaks
- Font sizes, spacing, padding adjustments
- Color scheme refinements
- Button styling and hover effects
- Icon improvements or additions
- Responsive design tweaks for mobile/tablet

#### Layout Improvements
- Component positioning and alignment
- Sidebar organization
- Statistics bar formatting
- Verse display layout
- Panel sizing and proportions

#### User Experience
- Clearer labels or instructions
- Better visual hierarchy
- Improved tooltips or help text
- Loading states and feedback
- Error message clarity

#### Functional Enhancements
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Search improvements
- Filter UX refinements
- Navigation improvements
- Accessibility improvements

### System Architecture

**Frontend:** Single-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface (`web/biblical_figurative_interface.html`)
- No build process - direct HTML/CSS/JS editing
- Inline styles and scripts for simplicity
- Yellow highlighting for figurative language
- Dual-column Hebrew (RTL) and English display

**Backend:** Flask API (`web/api_server.py`)
- SQLite database with 8,373 verses
- Flask-Caching with 5-min TTL
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Auto-deploys from GitHub main branch

**Production:** https://tzafun.onrender.com
- Free tier hosting (512MB RAM)
- ~2-3 minute deploy time
- No persistent disk (database from git)

### Important Files

**Main Interface File:**
- `web/biblical_figurative_interface.html` - All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file
  - Line ~1-700: HTML structure and inline CSS
  - Line ~700-2500: JavaScript application logic
  - Sections: Filters, search, pagination, highlighting, rendering

**Backend (if needed):**
- `web/api_server.py` - Flask API endpoints
- `database/Pentateuch_Psalms_fig_language.db` - SQLite database

**Documentation:**
- `README_INTERNAL.md` - Project status and recent changes
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_DECISIONS.md` - High-level decisions and architecture

### How to Start

1. **Local Testing:**
```bash
cd web
python api_server.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Edit `web/biblical_figurative_interface.html` for UI tweaks
   - Test locally in browser
   - Refresh page to see changes (no build needed)

3. **Deploy:**
```bash
git add web/biblical_figurative_interface.html
git commit -m "ui: [description of changes]"
git push origin main
```

### Success Criteria

- âœ… UI improvements enhance user experience
- âœ… Changes look good on desktop and mobile
- âœ… All existing functionality still works
- âœ… Changes are tested locally before pushing
- âœ… Code is clean and well-commented

### Recent UI Enhancements (Already Working)
