# Next Session: Preparing for Public Release

## Context
We're working on **Tzafun** (https://tzafun.onrender.com), a biblical figurative language concordance with 8,373 analyzed verses (Torah + Psalms) and 5,933 figurative language instances.

**Current Status (Oct 1, 2025)**:
- âœ… **Production Deployment** - Live at https://tzafun.onrender.com on Render.com free tier
- âœ… **Full UI Implementation** - Complete interface with About page, tooltips, search, filters
- âœ… **Performance Optimized** - 100-1300x speedup through database indexes and caching
- âœ… **Hebrew Highlighting Fixed** - All verses with maqaf now highlight correctly
- âœ… **About Page Complete** - Comprehensive documentation with TOC, Sacred Names section
- âœ… **UI Polish** - Elegant color palette, tooltips, 25 verses per page load

**What's Working Well**:
- System is stable and fast on free tier (512MB RAM)
- All features tested and functional
- Professional, polished user interface
- Clear documentation for end users

## Current Task: Public Release Preparation

The system is **fully functional and deployed**. Now we need to prepare the GitHub repository for public release by creating proper documentation and licensing.

### Three Main Tasks

#### 1. **Create Public-Facing README.md**

We currently have `README_INTERNAL.md` (development documentation). We need a **public README.md** that will be the first thing people see when they visit the GitHub repository.

**What to Include**:
- Project title and tagline
- Live demo link (https://tzafun.onrender.com)
- Clear description of what Tzafun is and why it's useful
- Key features (bullet points)
- Screenshots or demo GIF (optional but recommended)
- Quick start guide for local development
- Technologies used
- Citation information (how to cite in academic work)
- Link to About page for detailed documentation
- Contributing guidelines (basic)
- Contact/feedback information
- Acknowledgements

**Reference**: See `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_DECISIONS.md` sections on "Project Vision" and "What Users Will Experience"

**Tone**: Professional, academic, welcoming to both scholars and general users

---

#### 2. **Add License Files**

Based on `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_DECISIONS.md`, we should use:
- **MIT License** for code (recommended for maximum reuse)
- **CC BY 4.0** for database/data

**Files to Create**:

a) **`LICENSE-CODE.txt`** - MIT License for all code
   - Standard MIT license text
   - Copyright holder: Ari Robicsek
   - Year: 2025

b) **`LICENSE-DATA.txt`** - CC BY 4.0 for database
   - Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
   - Applies to: Database, annotations, AI-generated metadata
   - Requires: Attribution when used in research

c) **Update `README.md`** - Add license section explaining the dual licensing

**Why This Matters**:
- Clarifies how others can legally use the work
- Ensures proper attribution in academic use
- Standard practice for open-source academic projects
- Protects both creator and users

---

#### 3. **Create CITATION.cff File**

A `CITATION.cff` file provides standardized citation information for academic use. GitHub automatically displays this in the repository UI.

**File Format**: YAML format, GitHub-standard
**Location**: Root directory as `CITATION.cff`

**Required Fields**:
- Title
- Authors (name, affiliation, ORCID if available)
- Version
- Date released
- Repository URL
- License
- Keywords
- Abstract
- Preferred citation format

**Why This Matters**:
- Makes it easy for researchers to cite the work correctly
- Appears in GitHub UI as "Cite this repository"
- Standard for academic software/data projects
- Helps track impact and usage

**Reference Example**:
```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: "If you use this software, please cite it as below."
authors:
  - family-names: "Robicsek"
    given-names: "Ari"
title: "Tzafun: A Concordance of Figurative Language in the Torah and Psalms"
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2025-01-01
url: "https://github.com/ARobicsek/bible-figurative-language"
```

---

## Important Files for Reference

- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_DECISIONS.md`** - Contains strategic decisions about licensing, naming, architecture
- **`README_INTERNAL.md`** - Development history, technical achievements, current status
- **`web/biblical_figurative_interface.html`** - Main application (for describing features)
- **About Page** (in interface) - End-user documentation to reference in README

## Repository Information

- **Current Repository**: https://github.com/ARobicsek/bible-figurative-language
- **Live Deployment**: https://tzafun.onrender.com
- **Project Name**: Tzafun (×¦Ö¸×¤Ö»×Ÿ) - "hidden" or "treasure"
- **Full Title**: "Tzafun: A Concordance of Figurative Language in the Torah and Psalms"
- **Current Status**: Private repository, fully functional production deployment
- **Database Size**: 49MB SQLite, 8,373 verses, 5,933 figurative language instances
- **Technology Stack**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, Flask backend, SQLite database

## After These Tasks

Once we complete these three tasks, the repository will be ready to:
- Make public on GitHub
- Share with academic community
- Submit to relevant forums (r/DigitalHumanities, etc.)
- List in awesome-lists (awesome-digital-humanities, etc.)
- Share with scholars and potential users

## Success Criteria

âœ… Public README.md exists and is clear, professional, and comprehensive
âœ… License files (MIT for code, CC BY 4.0 for data) are present
âœ… CITATION.cff file is properly formatted and contains correct information
âœ… All files reference each other appropriately
âœ… Repository is ready for public release
