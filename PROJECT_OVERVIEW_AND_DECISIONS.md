## üìä Current Project State

### What We Have Built

#### 1. **Processing Pipeline (PRIVATE - Not Being Shared)**
- **Three-tier AI architecture**: Gemini 2.5 Flash ‚Üí Gemini 2.5 Pro ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4
- **Automatic fallback system**: Handles truncation, complexity, API errors
- **Parallel processing**: 12-worker concurrent processing with intelligent load balancing
- **Complete validation pipeline**: Separate AI validation pass with reclassification
- **Model tracking**: Records which AI model processed each instance for transparency
- **Non-sacred text generation**: Automatic Hebrew divine name modification for traditional Jewish users

**Why not sharing:** API costs (~$X spent analyzing 5,846 verses). Cannot afford to provide public access to annotation pipeline.

#### 2. **Database (SHARING - Complete Torah)**
- **5,846 verses** analyzed from Genesis through Deuteronomy
- **3,020 figurative language instances** identified and validated (need to count)
- **7 figurative types**: Metaphor, Simile, Personification, Idiom, Hyperbole, Metonymy, Other
- **Dual-language support**: Hebrew with vowel points + English translations
- **Rich metadata**: Target, Vehicle, Ground, Posture hierarchical classifications
- **Complete audit trail**: Detection deliberation, validation reasoning, confidence scores
- **Model transparency**: Every instance tagged with the AI model that analyzed it

**Database size:** ~30 MB SQLite (~50 MB with indexes)

#### 3. **Web Interface (SHARING - Production Ready)**
- **Dual-column display**: Hebrew (RTL) and English side-by-side
- **Advanced filtering**:
  - By book, chapter, verse
  - By figurative type (with multi-select)
  - "Not Figurative" option to view verses WITHOUT figurative language
  - "Select All" to view ALL verses (figurative + non-figurative)
- **Dual-language search**: Hebrew and English text search with highlighting
- **Metadata search**: Filter by Target/Vehicle/Ground/Posture with multi-term support
- **Sacred/Non-sacred toggle**: Switch between original and modified Hebrew text versions
- **Interactive annotations**: Click verses for AI deliberations, click highlights for detailed analysis
- **Hebrew virtual keyboard**: On-screen keyboard for Hebrew input
- **Mobile responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Performance optimized**: Lazy loading, background counting, smart pagination

**Technologies:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Flask (Python backend), SQLite database

**Architecture:**
```
Frontend ‚Üí Netlify Functions (Flask-like) ‚Üí Supabase
```

**Pros:**
- **Minimal frontend changes**: Keep existing API calls mostly intact
- **Custom logic**: Can add validation, rate limiting, custom queries
- **Abstraction**: Hide database details from frontend
- **Familiar**: You already know Flask

**Cons:**
