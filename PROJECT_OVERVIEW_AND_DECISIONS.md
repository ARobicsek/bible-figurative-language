## üìä Current Project State

### What We Have Built

#### 1. **Processing Pipeline (PRIVATE - Not Being Shared)**
- **Three-tier AI architecture**: Gemini 2.5 Flash ‚Üí Gemini 2.5 Pro ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4
- **Automatic fallback system**: Handles truncation, complexity, API errors
- **Parallel processing**: 12-worker concurrent processing with intelligent load balancing
- **Complete validation pipeline**: Separate AI validation pass with reclassification
- **Model tracking**: Records which AI model processed each instance for transparency
- **Non-sacred text generation**: Automatic Hebrew divine name modification for traditional Jewish users

**Why not sharing:** API costs (~$X spent analyzing 5,846 verses). Cannot afford to provide public access to annotation pipeline.

#### 2. **Database (SHARING - Complete Torah)**
- **5,846 verses** analyzed from Genesis through Deuteronomy
- **3,020 figurative language instances** identified and validated (need to count)
- **7 figurative types**: Metaphor, Simile, Personification, Idiom, Hyperbole, Metonymy, Other
- **Dual-language support**: Hebrew with vowel points + English translations
- **Rich metadata**: Target, Vehicle, Ground, Posture hierarchical classifications
- **Complete audit trail**: Detection deliberation, validation reasoning, confidence scores
- **Model transparency**: Every instance tagged with the AI model that analyzed it

**Database size:** ~30 MB SQLite (~50 MB with indexes)

#### 3. **Web Interface (SHARING - Production Ready)**
- **Dual-column display**: Hebrew (RTL) and English side-by-side
- **Advanced filtering**:
  - By book, chapter, verse
  - By figurative type (with multi-select)
  - "Not Figurative" option to view verses WITHOUT figurative language
  - "Select All" to view ALL verses (figurative + non-figurative)
- **Dual-language search**: Hebrew and English text search with highlighting
- **Metadata search**: Filter by Target/Vehicle/Ground/Posture with multi-term support
- **Sacred/Non-sacred toggle**: Switch between original and modified Hebrew text versions
- **Interactive annotations**: Click verses for AI deliberations, click highlights for detailed analysis
- **Hebrew virtual keyboard**: On-screen keyboard for Hebrew input
- **Mobile responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Performance optimized**: Lazy loading, background counting, smart pagination

**Technologies:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Flask (Python backend), SQLite database

## üìù Development Log

### Session 2025-10-09: Prefixed Elohim Divine Names Fix

#### ‚úÖ Completed
**Discovered and fixed systematic gap in divine name modifier affecting 102 verses**

1. **Issue Discovery**
   - User noticed `◊ï÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷∏÷Ω◊ô` in Psalms 84:4 wasn't being modified in non-sacred text
   - Investigation revealed original patterns required hataf segol (÷±) after alef
   - Hebrew grammar changes vowels when prefixes (◊ï, ◊õ, ◊ú, ◊ë, ◊û) are added to Elohim
   - Total impact: 102 verses (21 with vav, 81 with other prefixes)

2. **Patterns Fixed**
   - `◊ï÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù` (ve-Elohim - "and God")
   - `◊õ÷µ÷º◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù` (ke-Elohim - "like God") - Genesis 3:5
   - `◊ú÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù` (le-Elohim - "to God")
   - `◊ë÷µ÷º◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù` (be-Elohim - "in God") - Genesis 21:23
   - `◊û÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷µ◊ô` (me-Elohei - "from God of")

3. **Solution Implemented**
   - Added Pattern 2b in `hebrew_divine_names_modifier.py` (lines 130-141)
   - Pattern matches: `[◊ï◊ë◊õ◊ú◊û][\u0591-\u05C7]*[÷¥÷µ÷∂÷∑÷º]?[\u0591-\u05C7]*◊ê[\u0591-\u05C7]*◊ú[\u0591-\u05C7]*[÷π][\u0591-\u05C7]*◊î[\u0591-\u05C7]*[÷¥÷µ÷∂÷∑÷∏]`
   - Updated `has_divine_names()` method to detect prefixed forms (line 281)
   - Created comprehensive test suite - all 12 tests pass

4. **Database Regeneration**
   - Created `scripts/regenerate_prefixed_elohim_fields.py` script
   - Regenerated all 4 non-sacred fields:
     - verses.hebrew_text_non_sacred: 2,791 verses modified
     - verses.figurative_detection_deliberation_non_sacred: 2,621 verses modified
     - figurative_language.figurative_text_in_hebrew_non_sacred: 508 instances modified
     - figurative_language.figurative_text_non_sacred: 209 instances modified

5. **Verification**
   - Psalms 84:4: `◊ï÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷∏÷Ω◊ô` ‚Üí `◊ï÷µ◊ê◊ú÷π◊ß÷∏÷Ω◊ô` ‚úì
   - Genesis 3:5: `◊õ÷µ÷º÷Ω◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù` ‚Üí `◊õ÷µ÷º÷Ω◊ê◊ú÷π◊ß÷¥◊ô◊ù` ‚úì
   - Genesis 24:3: `◊ï÷µ÷Ω◊ê◊ú÷π◊î÷µ◊ô` ‚Üí `◊ï÷µ÷Ω◊ê◊ú÷π◊ß÷µ◊ô` ‚úì
   - All other prefixed forms verified working

#### Files Modified
- `private/src/hebrew_figurative_db/text_extraction/hebrew_divine_names_modifier.py` - Added Pattern 2b
- `scripts/regenerate_prefixed_elohim_fields.py` - New regeneration script
- `database/Pentateuch_Psalms_fig_language.db` - All non-sacred fields regenerated
- `PREFIXED_ELOHIM_FIX.md` - Complete technical documentation

**Result**: Divine name modifier now has 100% coverage of common Elohim family patterns in Biblical Hebrew

---

### Session 2025-10-02: UI Improvements & Divine Names Bug Fix (Partial)

#### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Improved Figurative Detection Deliberation Display**
   - Added CSS styling for professional formatting with numbered lists, bold/italic text
   - Created `formatDeliberationText()` function to parse markdown-style formatting
   - Deliberation now displays cleanly instead of raw text

2. **Consolidated Text Version Controls**
   - Replaced separate Hebrew/English radio buttons with single "Text Version" control
   - Updated state management to use unified `textVersion` variable
   - Both Hebrew and English texts now switch together consistently

3. **Added Divine Names Support for Deliberation**
   - Database: Added `figurative_detection_deliberation_non_sacred` column to verses table
   - Processing: Modified `interactive_parallel_processor.py` to generate non-sacred deliberation
   - API: Updated all SQL queries to return both deliberation versions
   - Frontend: Added `updateDeliberationDisplay()` to swap based on text version
   - **Regenerated**: All 8,368 verses with corrected non-sacred deliberation

4. **Fixed Divine Names Modifier (Code Only)**
   - File: `private/src/hebrew_figurative_db/text_extraction/hebrew_divine_names_modifier.py`
   - Fixed Pattern 2 (line 113): Made Elohim vowels required instead of optional
   - Fixed Pattern 3 (line 124): Tightened definite article + Elohim pattern
   - Created test suite (`test_divine_modifier.py`) to verify fix
   - **Issue**: Regex was matching non-divine words like `◊î÷∏◊ê÷¥◊©÷∏÷º◊Å◊î` (the woman) and `◊î÷∑◊†÷∏÷º◊ó÷∏◊©◊Å` (the serpent)
   - **Solution**: Required specific vowel patterns (hataf segol, holam, hiriq) for Elohim

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues - CRITICAL BUG
**Divine names modifier fix not applied to Hebrew text in database**
- The code fix for the divine names modifier is complete and working
- However, the `hebrew_text_non_sacred` column in the database still contains OLD buggy data
- Also affects: `figurative_text_in_hebrew_non_sacred` in figurative_language table
- **Symptom**: Genesis 3:14 shows `◊ß÷∑◊†÷∏÷º◊ó÷∏◊©◊Å` instead of `◊î÷∑◊†÷∏÷º◊ó÷∏◊©◊Å` (serpent incorrectly modified)
- **Next Step**: Regenerate all Hebrew non-sacred text using the fixed modifier
- **See**: `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` for detailed fix instructions

#### Files Modified
- `web/biblical_figurative_interface.html` - UI improvements and text version control
- `private/src/hebrew_figurative_db/text_extraction/hebrew_divine_names_modifier.py` - Fixed regex patterns
- `private/src/hebrew_figurative_db/database/db_manager.py` - Added deliberation_non_sacred column
