## 🌟 Overview

The Hebrew Figurative Language Explorer is a comprehensive research tool that provides access to 5,846 verses from the Torah (Genesis through Deuteronomy), analyzed for figurative language using advanced AI models. It originated with the question - couldn't we use powerful AI tools to compile a 'concordance' of biblical figurative speech? The database now contains 3,020 validated instances of figurative language, including metaphors, similes, personifications, idioms, hyperboles, and metonymies from across the Pentateuch.

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 Interactive search across Hebrew and English text
- 📊 Advanced filtering by figurative type, book, chapter, and metadata
- 🕊️ Sacred/non-sacred text toggle for traditional Jewish scholarship
- 📖 Dual-language display with proper Hebrew (RTL) support
- 🎯 Rich metadata including Target/Vehicle/Ground/Posture classifications
- 🤖 Complete AI transparency with full deliberation records

## 🔬 Methodology

This database was created using a robust AI analysis pipeline with intelligent fallback handling:

**AI Model Strategy:**
- **Primary Model** (Gemini 2.5 Flash): Handles both initial detection and validation for most verses
- **Fallback Model** (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Used when Flash encounters complexity or token limits
- **Final Fallback** (Claude Sonnet 4): Reserved for extremely complex passages that exceed both Gemini models' capabilities

**Two-Stage Process:**
1. **Detection Stage**: AI analyzes each verse to identify figurative language and classify types
2. **Validation Stage**: The same AI model validates its own detections, with capability to reclassify or reject false positives

Each verse includes:
- Initial AI detection reasoning
- Validation decision and reasoning
- Reclassification notes (if applicable)
- Confidence scores
- Model attribution (which AI was used)

**Classification Framework:**

The analysis uses a structured metadata system to characterize each figurative instance:

- **TARGET** = WHO/WHAT the figurative speech is ABOUT (the subject being described)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" → Target: Judah*

- **VEHICLE** = WHAT the target is being LIKENED TO (the comparison/image used)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" → Vehicle: lion*

- **GROUND** = WHAT QUALITY of the target is being described (the shared characteristic)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" → Ground: strength*

- **POSTURE** = SPEAKER ATTITUDE/STANCE toward the subject (emotional orientation)
  - *Example: Celebratory, critical, warning, etc.*
