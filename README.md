# Tzafun

**A concordance of Biblical figurative language**

*"Tzafun" (◊¶÷∏◊§÷ª◊ü) means "hidden" or "concealed" and also implies treasure, as in Psalms 31:20: "How abundant is the good that You have in store (◊¶÷∏◊§÷∑÷¢◊†÷∞◊™÷∏÷º) for those who fear You" and Psalm 119:11: "I have treasured (◊¶÷∏◊§÷∑÷£◊†÷∞◊™÷¥÷º◊ô) Your word in my heart."*

## üåü Overview

Tzafun is a comprehensive research tool that provides access to 8,373 verses from the Torah (Genesis through Deuteronomy) and Psalms, analyzed for figurative language using advanced AI models. It originated with the question - couldn't we use powerful AI tools to compile a 'concordance' of biblical figurative speech? The database now contains 5,865 validated instances of figurative language, including metaphors, similes, personifications, idioms, hyperboles, and metonymies from across the Pentateuch and all 150 chapters of Psalms.

**Key Features:**
- üîç Interactive search across Hebrew and English text
- üìä Advanced filtering by figurative type, book, chapter, and metadata
- üïäÔ∏è Sacred/non-sacred text toggle for traditional Jewish scholarship
- üìñ Dual-language display with proper Hebrew (RTL) support
- üéØ Rich metadata including Target/Vehicle/Ground/Posture classifications
- ü§ñ Complete AI transparency with full deliberation records

## üî¨ Methodology

This database was created using a robust AI analysis pipeline with intelligent fallback handling:

**AI Model Strategy:**
- **Primary Model** (Gemini 2.5 Flash): Handles both initial detection and validation for most verses
- **Fallback Model** (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Used when Flash encounters complexity or token limits
- **Final Fallback** (Claude Sonnet 4): Reserved for extremely complex passages that exceed both Gemini models' capabilities

**Two-Stage Process:**
1. **Detection Stage**: AI analyzes each verse to identify figurative language and classify types
2. **Validation Stage**: The same AI model validates its own detections, with capability to reclassify or reject false positives

Each verse includes:
- Initial AI detection reasoning
- Validation decision and reasoning
- Reclassification notes (if applicable)
- Confidence scores
- Model attribution (which AI was used)

**Classification Framework:**

The analysis uses a structured metadata system to characterize each figurative instance:

- **TARGET** = WHO/WHAT the figurative speech is ABOUT (the subject being described)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" ‚Üí Target: Judah*

- **VEHICLE** = WHAT the target is being LIKENED TO (the comparison/image used)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" ‚Üí Vehicle: lion*

- **GROUND** = WHAT QUALITY of the target is being described (the shared characteristic)
  - *Example: "Judah is a lion" ‚Üí Ground: strength*

- **POSTURE** = SPEAKER ATTITUDE/STANCE toward the subject (emotional orientation)
  - *Example: Celebratory, critical, warning, etc.*
