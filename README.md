## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment recommended

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARobicsek/bible-figurative-language
cd bible-figurative-language
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

#### LLM-Based Analysis (Recommended)
```python
from src.hebrew_figurative_db.pipeline import FigurativeLanguagePipeline

# Initialize with real Gemini API
pipeline = FigurativeLanguagePipeline(
    'analysis_output.db',
    use_llm_detection=True,
    use_actual_llm=True
)

# Process biblical text
results = pipeline.process_verses("Deuteronomy.30")
print(f"Found {results['figurative_found']} figurative instances")
```

#### Rule-Based Analysis (Fast)
```python
# Initialize with rule-based detection
pipeline = FigurativeLanguagePipeline(
    'analysis_output.db',
    use_llm_detection=False
)

results = pipeline.process_verses("Genesis.1")
```

### View Results
```python
# Interactive query interface
python query_database.py

# View specific datasets

```

## 📊 Research Quality Results

### Latest Results (Phase 7 Two-Level System)
- **Complete Deuteronomy Reprocessing**: All 34 chapters with improved two-level subcategory pipeline
- **Two-Level Classification**: Level 1 categories (The Natural World, Human Institutions and Relationships, Abstract and Internal States)
- **Enhanced Precision**: False positive reduction with specific literal exclusions
- **Migrated Database**: 646 existing records updated to hierarchical structure
- **100% Validation Accuracy**: Perfect classification on false positive test cases
- **Processing speed**: Maintained 1.85+ verses/second with enhanced accuracy

### Example Enhanced Vehicle/Tenor Analysis Output
```json
{
  "type": "metaphor",
  "figurative_text": "The ancient God is a refuge",
  "figurative_text_in_hebrew": "אלהי קדם מעונה",
  "explanation": "God is compared to a physical place of safety and protection",
  "vehicle_level_1": "Human Institutions and Relationships",
  "vehicle_level_2": "architectural",
  "tenor_level_1": "Divine-Human Relationship",
  "tenor_level_2": "Divine Provision",
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "speaker": "Moses",
  "purpose": "express divine protection and security for the people"
}
```

**Enhanced Classification Features:**
- **Refined Vehicle Categories**: Military vs social distinction, political-legal separation
- **New Vehicle Domains**: Body/Anatomy for anthropomorphic imagery, Ritual/Worship for ceremonial metaphors
- **Streamlined Tenor Categories**: Divine-Human Relationship and Covenant & Its Consequences
- **Precise Subcategories**: Divine Provision vs Blessing distinction, Idolatry classification

**Phase 7 Improvements:**
- **Two-level hierarchy**: "Human Institutions and Relationships | architectural"
- **False positive elimination**: Literal descriptions like "good land" correctly excluded
- **Enhanced accuracy**: Historical statements like "We were slaves" no longer misclassified
- **Standard idiom filtering**: Expressions like "stray from path" correctly identified as literal
```

### Detection Capabilities (Phase 6.5 Enhanced)
- **Metaphor**: Direct comparisons excluding religious titles ("God of gods") and technical terms ("holy people")
- **Simile**: Comparisons using Hebrew כְּ/כַּאֲשֶׁר excluding procedural instructions ("do X as Y")
- **Personification**: Human characteristics attributed to non-human entities beyond simple divine speech
- **Idiom**: Expressions with non-literal meanings
- **Hyperbole**: Deliberate exaggeration for emphasis with conservative thresholds
- **Metonymy**: Substitution with closely associated concepts
- **Semantic Subcategories**: Architectural, geological, elemental, military, agricultural, familial, natural, celestial domains
