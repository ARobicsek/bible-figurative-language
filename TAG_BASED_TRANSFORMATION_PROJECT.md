# Tag-Based Figurative Language System: Project Plan

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Transform the current rigid categorical system to a flexible tag-based approach that captures the multi-dimensional nature of biblical figurative language.

**Current System:** Single target_level_1/specific, vehicle_level_1/specific, ground_level_1/specific
**Target System:** Primary categories + unlimited flexible tags per dimension

**Expected Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Risk Level:** Medium (requires database migration and LLM prompt redesign)
