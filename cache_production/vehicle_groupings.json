Three core semantic domains emerged: the internal/emotional/life-giving aspects, the active/agentic/powerful aspects, and the perceptive/expressive/presentational aspects. Each vehicle was then assigned to the group that best represented its most common or salient figurative usage in biblical Hebrew. Care was taken to ensure every vehicle was placed in exactly one group, prioritizing functional similarity over mere anatomical location. Group names and descriptions were crafted to be intuitive and reflect these functional domains."
