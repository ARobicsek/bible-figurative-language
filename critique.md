Revised Plan: An Efficient, Human-in-the-Loop Approach
This revised plan leverages existing tools and an active learning strategy to create a high-quality database of figurative language in the Pentateuch with minimal human annotation effort. We will not build from scratch; instead, we will use existing, specialized models and frameworks as a foundation.

1. Rationale and Time-Saving Steps
The core shift is from a "manual annotation-first" to a "model-first" approach. By strategically using existing resources and frameworks, we can save significant time and resources:

Avoid Building a Model from Scratch: Instead of relying on general LLMs that lack domain-specific knowledge, we'll use a pre-trained Hebrew NLP model like BEREL from the start. BEREL is specifically trained on Rabbinic Hebrew, which is linguistically closer to Biblical Hebrew than modern Hebrew. This gives us a massive head start on understanding the language's grammar and semantics, skipping weeks or months of basic language modeling work.

Leverage Existing Rules: We won't be creating rules for finding figurative language from the ground up. The Text-Fabric framework itself provides a powerful query language for searching its detailed linguistic annotations. This allows for rapid creation of high-precision rules for common structures like similes (e.g., searching for the preposition "כְּ" followed by a noun). This provides a reliable, initial set of examples.

Targeted Annotation: The most significant time-saving measure is the active learning loop. Instead of a human annotating the entire Pentateuch, the AI will process the text and present only the most challenging or uncertain examples for review. This focuses human effort where it has the most impact, building a high-quality training dataset for the model to learn from. The human's job becomes a "teacher," not a "laborer."

Utilize Open-Source UIs: Instead of building a custom UI from scratch, we'll first evaluate existing, open-source annotation platforms designed for NLP tasks. Tools like Doccano or Label Studio are built for this exact purpose, offering features like annotation workflows, collaboration, and data management. This can save dozens of development hours.

2. Revised Execution Plan
Phase 1: Foundation and Initial Model Training (Weeks 1-2)
Environment Setup & Data Integration: Set up the Python virtual environment, install Text-Fabric, and integrate the ETCBC and Sefaria data pipelines.

Initial Rule-Based Detection: Use Text-Fabric's search language to create and run simple rules for high-precision detection (e.g., similes using "כְּ", personification by searching for human verbs on inanimate nouns, etc.). Save these results as a preliminary dataset.

Gold Standard Annotation: A human expert annotates a single, metaphorically rich chapter (e.g., Deuteronomy 30). This small, high-quality "seed" dataset, combined with the rule-based findings, will be used to fine-tune the model.

Initial Model Fine-Tuning: Use this seed data to fine-tune the BEREL model, teaching it to recognize figurative language patterns. This initial model will be the engine of your active learning loop.

Phase 2: The Active Learning Loop (Weeks 3-8+)
Model Prediction: The fine-tuned BEREL model processes a new, unannotated book (e.g., Genesis), generating predictions with confidence scores.

Uncertainty Sampling: The system automatically identifies the most ambiguous predictions (those with confidence scores below a certain threshold).

Human Annotation via a Simple UI: The human expert uses the chosen annotation UI (Doccano, Label Studio, or a simple custom-built Streamlit app) to review only these uncertain cases. They correct the model's errors, add missed annotations, and verify correct ones.

Model Retraining: The newly annotated, high-value data is added to the training set. The model is retrained on this expanded dataset.

Iterate: Repeat the loop on the next book. With each iteration, the model's accuracy improves, and the number of instances requiring human review decreases dramatically.

Phase 3: Analysis & Finalization (Weeks 9-10)
Full Text Processing: Once the model reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy, run it on the remaining, unannotated portions of the Pentateuch.

Database Population: The AI's final annotations (and their confidence scores) are added to the database.

Semantic Analysis: For the identified figurative language, a general LLM (Gemini/Claude) is used to perform a one-off semantic analysis of the source_domain and target_domain. The human can then review and refine these with the UI.

Query & Visualization: The final, curated database is ready for the proposed analytical questions and visualizations.

3. Annotation UI & Workflow
A simple, bespoke UI is the most efficient and practical solution. It will be built to specifically manage the active learning loop, rather than being a generic annotation tool.

Purpose: To present only the most challenging examples to a human for fast, targeted review.

Technology: Streamlit or a similar lightweight Python web framework.

Functionality:

Display: Show the biblical passage with the AI's predicted figurative phrases highlighted.

Annotation Panel: A simple side panel or form with fields for type (e.g., "Metaphor," "Simile"), source_domain, and target_domain.

Action Buttons: "Accept" to confirm the AI's prediction, "Modify" to correct it, or "Skip" to move to the next example.

Progress Bar: A visual tracker showing how many "uncertain" examples remain in the current batch.

The UI's simplicity is key. It's not a generic tool; it's a dedicated interface for a human to provide focused feedback to the AI, dramatically accelerating the training process.
