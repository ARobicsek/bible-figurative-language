2025-09-21 14:07:02,001 - ERROR - Extracted JSON string: [God]): I considered if the verb `דבק` (dabaq), which literally means "to cling, stick, cleave," is used literally or figuratively when applied to God. My reasoning is that physically clinging to God is not possible. Therefore, `דבק` is used metaphorically here to describe a deep spiritual and emotional attachment, unwavering devotion, loyalty, and commitment to God. It represents a cross-domain comparison from physical adhesion to spiritual fidelity. This is also a common biblical idiom for suc...
2025-09-21 14:07:02,001 - ERROR - Full response for debugging: DELIBERATION:
I have analyzed every potential figurative element in the provided Hebrew text and its English translation according to the given instructions.

1.  **לְאַֽהֲבָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ** (loving your God יהוה): I considered if "loving God" could be figurative. My reasoning is that this is a direct command or statement about a spiritual and emotional action. While love itself is an abstract concept, the act of loving God is presented as a literal, expected behavior and disposition within the covenant relationship. It is not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiom in this context. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.

2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (listening to His voice / heeding God’s commands): I considered if "listening to His voice" is a literal auditory act or a figurative expression. While "listening" is an auditory perception, in biblical Hebrew, "listening to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) is a well-established idiom that signifies obedience, com...

My reasoning is that this is a direct command or statement about a spiritual and emotional action. While love itself is an abstract concept, the act of loving God is presented as a literal, expected behavior and disposition within the covenant relationship. It is not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiom in this context. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (listening to His voice / heeding God’s commands): I considered if "listening to His voice" is a literal auditory act or a figurative expression. While "listening" is an auditory perception, in biblical Hebrew, "listening to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) is a well-established idiom that signifies obedience, compliance, and heeding the instructions or commands of X, rather than merely the physical act of hearing sounds. The English translation "heeding God\'s commands" accurately captures this idiomatic meaning. This falls under the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, I am including it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God]): I considered if the verb `דבק` (dabaq), which literally means "to cling, stick, cleave," is used literally or figuratively when applied to God. My reasoning is that physically clinging to God is not possible. Therefore, `דבק` is used metaphorically here to describe a deep spiritual and emotional attachment, unwavering devotion, loyalty, and commitment to God. It represents a cross-domain comparison from physical adhesion to spiritual fidelity. This is also a common biblical idiom for such a relationship. Therefore, I am including it as both a metaphor and an idiom.\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For He is your life): I considered if the statement "He is your life" is a literal identification or a metaphorical assertion. My reasoning is that God is not literally the biological process or the existential state of "life" itself. Instead, this statement identifies God as the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of life for the people. It is a profound direct metaphor, equating God with the very concept of life in a comprehensive and essential sense. This is a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, I am including it as a metaphor.\n\n5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and the length of your days / shall long endure): I considered if "the length of your days" is figurative. My reasoning is that this is a direct and literal statement referring to the duration of one\'s life or existence. It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or idiom. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (to dwell upon the soil/land): I considered if "to dwell upon the land" is figurative. My reasoning is that this describes a literal physical act of residing in a specific geographical location. It is standard narrative language and not figurative. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ** (that יהוה swore to your fathers): I considered if "יהוה swore" is figurative. My reasoning is that this is an anthropomorphism, attributing a human action (swearing) to God. According to the instructions, "Divine anthropomorphisms... are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Swearing is an action, not a body part. Therefore, I am treating it as literal and excluding it as figurative.\n\n8.  **לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם** (to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them): I considered if this phrase contains figurative language. My reasoning is that this is a straightforward statement of historical and genealogical information regarding God\'s promise to the patriarchs. It is standard narrative language and not figurative. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}
