While love has abstract qualities, the command itself is literal in its expectation of devotion and loyalty. It is not a metaphor, simile, or idiom in this context.\n\n2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ (heeding God’s commands / lit. listening to His voice)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "listening to His voice" (שְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ) is a literal act of hearing an audible sound or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, "listening to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) is a well-established idiom for obeying or heeding the commands, instructions, or words of X. While "voice" (קול) is a physical attribute, the phrase as a whole does not refer to literally hearing an audible sound from God, but rather to the act of internalizing and acting upon divine instruction. It functions as a metonymy where the medium of communication (voice) stands for the content of the communication (commands/words). Therefore, it is both an idiom and a form of metonymy.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue that God *could* speak audibly, making it literal. However, the common usage of this phrase across the Hebrew Bible, especially in didactic contexts like this, points strongly to its idiomatic meaning of obedience rather than merely auditory perception. The instruction to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type confirms this interpretation.\n\n3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ (and holding fast to [God])**\n    *   **Considered:** If "holding fast" (דבק) is literal or figurative when applied to God.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb דבק (dabaq) literally means to cling, stick, or adhere physically. When applied to an incorporeal entity like God, it is clearly a metaphor. One cannot physically "cling" to God. Instead, the physical act of clinging is used to describe a deep, unwavering spiritual, emotional, and relational commitment, loyalty, and devotion. This is a clear cross-domain comparison.\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙ (For thereby you shall have life / lit. For He is your life)**\n    *   **Considered:** If God is literally "life" or if this is a metaphorical identification.\n    *   **Reasoning:** God is not literally the biological process or state of being alive in the same way a human is "life." This is a profound metaphor that identifies God as the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of true, meaningful, and abundant life for the believer. It\'s a strong statement of identification, where the vehicle (life itself) is equated with the tenor (God). This is a clear cross-domain comparison.\n\n5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ (and shall long endure / lit. and the length of your days)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "length of your days" (אֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard Hebrew expression for longevity or a long life. While "length" is a spatial concept applied to time, this is a conventional and literal way of expressing duration in Hebrew and is not considered a metaphor, simile, or idiom in the sense of a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal phrase. It is a direct promise of extended life.\n\n6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה (upon the soil / lit. to dwell upon the land)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "the soil/land" (הָאֲדָמָ֗ה) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This refers literally to the physical land, specifically the Promised Land. No figurative language is present.\n\n7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם (that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them.)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "swore" (נִשְׁבַּ֨ע) is an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Swearing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific bodily part. Therefore, according to the guidelines, it is to be treated as literal in this context.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}
