While the nature of this love is spiritual, the act of loving itself is a direct human response and not a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice)**\n    *   Considered if "listening to His voice" is literal or figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: God does not possess a physical voice in the human sense that one literally hears with ears. The phrase "to listen to the voice of X" (שמע בקול) is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "to obey," "to heed," or "to pay attention to the words/commands of X." The "voice" (קול) here stands metonymically for the commands or instructions issued by God. It is a common way to express obedience to divine will.\n    *   Decision: Marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him)**\n    *   Considered if "holding fast" or "cleaving" to God is literal.\n    *   Reasoning: One cannot physically "hold fast" or "cleave" to an incorporeal God. This verb (דבק) typically describes physical adhesion or clinging. When applied to God, it functions as a metaphor for deep spiritual loyalty, unwavering commitment, and intimate relationship. It compares the abstract concept of spiritual devotion to the concrete act of physical attachment. Its frequent use in this context also qualifies it as a biblical idiom or set phrase for spiritual devotion.\n    *   Decision: Marked as figurative (metaphor, idiom).\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙ (For He is your life)**\n    *   Considered if "He is your life" is a literal statement of identity.\n    *   Reasoning: God is not literally "life" in the biological or existential sense of being the sum total of one\'s existence. Rather, He is the *source*, *sustainer*, and *giver* of life, and the one who imbues life with meaning and purpose. This is a strong metaphorical identification, equating God with the very essence of life, emphasizing His indispensable role in the well-being and existence of the people. It\'s a cross-domain comparison where God (divine entity) is equated with "life" (abstract concept/state of being).\n    *   Decision: Marked as figurative (metaphor).\n\n5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ (and the length of your days / shall long endure)**\n    *   Considered if "length of your days" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a standard, literal expression in Hebrew for longevity or a long lifespan. It refers directly to the duration of one\'s existence and is not a cross-domain comparison or a figurative idiom. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה (to dwell upon the soil / land)**\n    *   Considered if "dwelling upon the land" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This refers to the literal act of residing in the promised land. "Land" (אדמה) is used literally here. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ (that יהוה swore to your fathers)**\n    *   Considered if "יהוה swore" is figurative (anthropomorphism).\n    *   Reasoning: The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Swearing" is an action/declaration, not a reference to a physical body part. Therefore, according to the instructions, it is to be treated as literal in this context.\n\n8.  **לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them)**\n    *   Considered if the names or the act of giving are figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: These are literal historical figures and a literal act of promising/giving. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}
