2025-09-21 12:03:50,860 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Hyperbole - The phrase "ends of the sky/heavens" uses exaggerated spatial distance to emphasize the uttermost dispersion of the Israelites.  It's not meant to be taken literally as a physical location, but rather as a figure of speech conveying the vastness of their scattering.  The use of "sky" for "earth" is a common poetic device in biblical Hebrew.

It accurately reflects their status and condition, rather than serving as a figurative comparison or symbolic representation. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם (biqṣēh haššāmāyim) - "at the ends of the sky/heavens"**:\n    *   Considered: If this phrase is a literal geographical location, a metaphor, or hyperbole.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom used to denote the furthest possible reaches of the earth or the entire world. It is not meant to be understood as a literal physical edge of the atmosphere or cosmos. Its purpose is to convey extreme distance and the absolute extent of the people\'s dispersion, implying that no matter how far they are scattered, God\'s reach extends to them. While it inherently contains an element of hyperbole (exaggerating the distance to the maximum conceivable), its primary function is as a fixed expression for "the ends of the earth" or "the furthest reaches of the world." As per instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."\n    *   Borderline cases: I debated whether to classify this solely as hyperbole or as an idiom. I concluded that "idiom" is the more precise classification given that it is a conventional, set phrase with a recognized meaning of extreme distance, which inherently incorporates exaggeration.\n\n3.  **מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ (miššām yəqabbəṣəḵā YHWH ʾĕlōheḵā) - "from there your God יהוה will gather you"**:\n    *   Considered: If God "gathering" (קָבַץ) the people is an anthropomorphism or a metaphor for divine action.\n    *   Reasoning: "Gathering" is a common and literal divine action in the Hebrew Bible, referring to the reassembly of scattered individuals or groups. This is a standard description of God\'s intervention to bring the dispersed Israelites back together. It does not refer to a physical body part of God and is a literal statement of divine intent and action within the ANE context, consistent with the instructions regarding divine anthropomorphisms. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ (ūmiššām yiqqāḥeḵā) - "from there [God] will fetch you"**:\n    *   Considered: If God "fetching" or "taking" (לָקַח) the people is an anthropomorphism or a metaphor for divine action.\n    *   Reasoning: Similar to "gathering," "fetching" or "taking" is a literal description of God\'s action to retrieve or bring the people to a specific place or for a specific purpose. It is a standard verb for divine action and does not refer to a physical body part of God. It is a literal statement of God\'s intention. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

I have carefully analyzed each phrase in the provided Hebrew text and its English translation, considering the specific instructions for identifying figurative language.

1.  **וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ** (And your God יהוה will bring you to the land): I considered if "God will bring you" constitutes a figurative anthropomorphism. However, the instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." The act of "bringing" (הביא) is an action, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, this is understood as a literal divine action within the ANE worldview and is not marked as figurative.

2.  **אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ** (that your fathers possessed): This phrase describes a historical fact regarding the ancestors' possession of the land. It is a straightforward, literal statement of past action and ownership. No figurative elements are present here.

3.  **וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ** (and you shall possess it): This is a direct promise of future possession of the land. It is a literal statement of intent and outcome, not employing any figurative language.

4.  **וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥** (and [God] will make you more prosperous / will do good to you): This describes a divine act of blessing and improving the condition of the people. It is a literal promise of well-being and prosperity, not a metaphor or other figurative device.

5.  **וְהִרְבְּךָ֖** (and [God] will make you more numerous): This refers to a literal increase in population, a common form of divine blessing in the biblical narrative. It is a direct and literal statement of quantitative growth.

6.  **מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** (than your ancestors): This phrase completes the comparison, stating that God will make them "more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors." The instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This is a direct proportional comparison of quantity and quality (prosperity/numbers). Therefore, it is a literal statement of comparative degree and is not considered figurative.

Based on a thorough examination of each component and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, I find no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or idioms (as defined) in this verse. The divine actions are to be interpreted literally within the ANE context, and comparisons are explicitly excluded from being marked as figurative.

2025-09-21 12:04:24,333 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Metaphor - The text uses the physical act of circumcision, a known practice in the ANE context, as a metaphor to describe the spiritual transformation of the heart.  The heart is not literally circumcised; rather, the image conveys a profound inner change, making it receptive to God's love. This is a clear example of a cross-domain transfer (physical to spiritual).

2025-09-21 12:04:25,132 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Merism - The phrase "with all your heart and soul" is a genuine merism, a figure of speech where two or more terms are used to express a single concept comprehensively.  It doesn't represent a literal anatomical division but rather signifies complete and total devotion, encompassing the entirety of one's being.  The original classification is correct.

Applying this verb to the "heart," which in this context represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, is physically impossible. This represents a clear cross-domain mapping where a physical action (circumcision) is used to describe a spiritual or internal transformation. The purpose is to convey the idea of removing spiritual impurity or hardness, making the heart receptive to God\'s love and commands. This is a well-established biblical metaphor for spiritual purification and transformation. The accompanying footnote "open up*open up Others “circumcise.”" explicitly highlights the non-literal nature of the action on the heart, indicating an interpretive challenge that points to figurative language. Therefore, this is a metaphor.\n\n2.  **"לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖" (to love your God יהוה with all your heart and soul)**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the phrase "with all your heart and soul" (בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖) is a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The individual terms "heart" (לֵבָב) and "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) are commonly used in Hebrew to refer to the totality of one\'s inner being, intellect, will, emotions, and life force. While they are not literal physical organs in this context, their usage here is not a fresh metaphor but rather a conventional, fixed expression. The combination "with all your heart and with all your soul" is a very common biblical idiom (a merism) used to emphasize complete and total devotion, encompassing one\'s entire being. According to the provided guidelines, "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, this phrase is an idiom.\n\n3.  **"לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ" (in order that you may live)**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "live" (חַיֶּיךָ) here has a figurative meaning beyond mere physical existence.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While "life" in a biblical context often implies a full, blessed, and covenantal existence, this is a literal consequence of obedience and love for God. It refers to a real, tangible state of being, both physically and in terms of well-being and flourishing within the covenant. There is no clear cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile present. Therefore, it is not figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}
