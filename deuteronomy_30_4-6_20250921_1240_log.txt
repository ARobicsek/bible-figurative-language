However, "outcasts" directly describes the state and identity of the dispersed people. It is a literal designation for those who have been driven out or scattered, rather than a figurative stand-in for another concept. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n*   **"בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" / "at the ends of the world (Lit. \'sky\')":** I considered several possibilities for this phrase:\n    *   **Literal geographical location:** While "sky" (שָׁמַיִם) is a literal cosmic element, "the ends of the sky" is not a precise, physically reachable point on Earth. It\'s not a place one could literally travel to.\n    *   **Metaphor:** It could be argued as a metaphor for extreme distance, comparing the vastness of the dispersion to the unreachable edges of the sky. However, it functions more directly as an exaggeration.\n    *   **Idiom:** This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom (e.g., Deuteronomy 4:32, Nehemiah 1:9) used to denote the furthest possible extent of the earth or the known world, beyond normal human reach. It functions as a set phrase for "the ends of the earth" or "the remotest parts."\n    *   **Hyperbole:** By referring to the "ends of the sky," the text employs an overstatement to emphasize the vastness and extremity of the dispersion, suggesting a distance so great that it seems impossible for humans to traverse or for the dispersed to be gathered from. This exaggeration serves to highlight God\'s omnipotence in reaching them anywhere.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I determined that this phrase functions as both an **idiom** and **hyperbole**. It is an idiomatic expression for extreme distance, and that idiom inherently uses hyperbole to convey the immense scale of the dispersion.\n\n*   **"מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" / "from there your God יהוה will gather you":** I considered if "God will gather you" is a figurative expression, such as a metaphor for spiritual restoration or a non-literal divine action. The guidelines state that "Divine anthropomorphisms... are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The act of "gathering" (קָבַץ) is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. In the ANE worldview, God\'s actions, even when described in human-like terms, were understood as literal divine interventions in the world. This refers to God\'s direct, literal act of bringing the dispersed people back together. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n*   **"וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ" / "from there [God] will fetch you":** Similar to the previous phrase, I considered if "God will fetch you" is figurative. "Fetching" or "taking" (לָקַח) is also an action attributed to God, not a body part. Consistent with the guidelines for divine anthropomorphisms, this is understood as a literal divine action of God bringing the people back. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

1.  **"וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ" (And your God יהוה will bring you):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether the action of God "bringing" (הֵבִיא) could be interpreted as a figurative anthropomorphism.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." The act of "bringing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, it is to be understood literally as God's direct intervention and action in leading the people.
    *   **Borderline:** Not borderline, as the instruction is clear and this action does not refer to a body part.

2.  **"אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ" (to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether the concept of "possessing" (יָרַשׁ) land could be used metaphorically for something other than literal ownership or inheritance.
    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "possessing" refers to the literal act of inheriting and taking ownership of a physical territory. This is standard historical and legal language for land tenure in the ancient Near East. It falls under "Standard narrative language" and "Historical and genealogical information," which are to be treated conservatively and literally.
    *   **Borderline:** Not borderline.

3.  **"וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥" (and [God] will make you more prosperous):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether "making prosperous" (from יטב, to do good, make well) could be a metaphorical description of divine blessing.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct statement of a divine promise and outcome – a literal increase in well-being, good fortune, and favorable conditions. It describes a tangible state of affairs rather than using a cross-domain comparison. It is standard narrative language describing a divine blessing.
    *   **Borderline:** Not borderline.

4.  **"וְהִרְבְּךָ֖" (and [God] will make you more numerous):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether "making numerous" (from רבה, to be many, increase) could be a metaphorical description of growth or influence.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct statement of a divine promise and outcome – a literal increase in population. It describes a tangible demographic reality rather than using a cross-domain comparison. It is standard narrative language describing a divine blessing.
    *   **Borderline:** Not borderline.

5.  **"מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ" (than your ancestors):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether the comparison implied by "more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors" constitutes figurative language (e.g., a simile or hyperbole).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a comparative statement indicating a greater degree of prosperity and numerousness in the future compared to the past. The instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This comparison falls squarely under "proportional or behavioral comparisons" as it compares the *degree* of a state. Therefore, it is to be understood literally as a quantitative comparison.
    *   **Borderline:** Not borderline, as the instruction is explicit.

Based on a thorough review of each phrase against the provided guidelines, no elements in this verse qualify as figurative language.

Therefore, this must be understood figuratively. It is a **metaphor** where the physical act of circumcision (removal of an impediment, dedication to a covenant) is applied to the spiritual realm of the heart. The purpose is to signify a profound inner transformation, a removal of spiritual hardness or resistance, enabling love and obedience. Furthermore, "circumcision of the heart" is a well-established **idiom** in biblical literature (e.g., Deut 10:16, Jer 4:4, Rom 2:29) referring to this spiritual change.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None, this is a clear figurative expression.\n\n2.  **"אֶת־לְבָבְךָ֖ / your heart"** (first instance) and **"וְאֶת־לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ / and the hearts of your offspring"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "heart" (לֵבָב) refers to the literal physical organ or to the inner self.\n    *   **Reasoning**: In biblical Hebrew, "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently used as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral character, representing the inner person rather than solely the physical organ. This is a common literary device where a part (the heart) stands for the whole (the inner being or personality). This is a clear instance of **metonymy** (specifically, synecdoche, where a part represents the whole).\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None, this is a standard biblical usage.\n\n3.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ / with all your heart and soul"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If this phrase is a literal description of physical organs or a figurative expression of totality.\n    *   **Reasoning**: As established, "heart" (לֵבָב) here is **metonymy** for the inner self. Similarly, "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) is also a **metonymy** for the entire being, life force, or self. The combination "with all your heart and soul" is a well-known **idiom** in biblical Hebrew, signifying complete and unreserved devotion, commitment, and totality of one\'s being. It is not meant to be understood as literally engaging physical organs, but rather the entirety of one\'s inner and outer self.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None, this is a standard biblical idiom.\n\n4.  **"לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ / in order that you may live"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "live" (חַיֶּיךָ) refers only to physical existence or also to spiritual flourishing.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While "life" in a covenantal context often implies spiritual vitality and holistic well-being beyond mere physical existence, the primary and most direct meaning of "live" is physical life and continued existence. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and to avoid marking proportional or behavioral comparisons as figurative, "live" is best understood as a literal consequence (physical life, prosperity, well-being in the land) that also carries deeper theological implications, but is not itself a clear metaphor or other figurative device in this immediate context. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: This could be debated in a theological context, but for the purpose of identifying *figurative language* as defined by the prompt, it falls outside the criteria for metaphor, simile, or personification.', 'fallback_used': False}
