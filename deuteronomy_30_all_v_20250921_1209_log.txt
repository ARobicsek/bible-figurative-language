2025-09-21 12:10:09,322 - INFO -       VALIDATION FAILED: Standard Biblical Divine Action -  The phrase "I have set before you" describes God presenting choices, a common way of depicting divine agency in the ANE context.  It's not a metaphorical transfer of meaning from a concrete domain to an abstract one; it's a standard way of describing God's actions in offering blessings and curses.  While it might seem figurative in modern understanding, it's a literal description of divine action within the ANE worldview.

The verb בוא (to come) typically describes physical movement, but here it is applied to abstract "things" (הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה, referring to blessing and curse) happening to a person.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** While abstract concepts do not literally "come" or "befall" in a physical sense, this is a highly conventional and common expression in Hebrew (and many other languages) to describe the occurrence or experience of events or circumstances. It treats abstract events as if they are agents that can approach or land upon someone. This makes it a figurative idiom, as it uses language of physical action to describe an abstract occurrence. It is not a literal statement of physical movement.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** It could be argued as a mild personification (giving agency to abstract "things") or a metaphor (comparing the occurrence of events to something physically arriving). However, given its conventional usage as a set phrase for events happening, "idiom" is the most appropriate classification as per the instructions for "biblical idioms and set phrases."\n\n2.  **Phrase: נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ (natati l\'faneykha) - "I have set before you"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether this phrase is a literal statement or a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The "blessing and curse" are abstract concepts, not physical objects that can be literally "set" or "placed" in front of someone. The phrase uses the imagery of presenting physical items for inspection or choice to convey the idea of presenting options or consequences. This is a clear figurative idiom, as it employs concrete imagery to describe an abstract act of presentation.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a straightforward and widely recognized biblical idiom.\n\n3.  **Phrase: אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ (el l\'vavekha) - "to your heart" (in the context of וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ - "and you take them to heart")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "heart" here refers to the physical organ or is a metonymy for the mind/intellect/inner being, and if the entire phrase "take to heart" is an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of thought, will, memory, and emotion, not merely the physical organ. The phrase וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ (literally "and you will return/bring to your heart") is a well-established idiom meaning to reflect deeply, consider, remember, or internalize. It is not a literal action involving the physical heart. The use of "heart" for the mind/inner self is a form of metonymy, and the entire phrase functions as a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a classic biblical idiom with a metonymic basis.\n\n4.  **Other phrases/concepts:**\n    *   **כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה** ("all these things, the blessing and the curse"): These are literal references to the covenant consequences.\n    *   **אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה** ("to which your God יהוה has banished you"): This describes a literal action of God (banishment) and a literal destination (nations).

2025-09-21 12:10:33,650 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Metaphor -  The phrase "return to God" does not describe a literal physical journey.  In the context of the passage, it represents a spiritual turning away from disobedience and towards a renewed commitment to God's covenant. This is a common metaphorical expression in religious contexts, signifying repentance and rededication.  The original confidence of 1.0 is justified.

While "hearing God's voice" could *literally* refer to an audible voice, the context makes it clear that it refers to understanding and obeying God's commands.

It does not imply a physical change of location for the individual or for God.

"and you listen to his voice"):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "listening to his voice" refers to a literal auditory perception or if it\'s a figurative way of expressing obedience.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While God can speak audibly, in the vast majority of biblical contexts, "listening to God\'s voice" (שמע בקול) functions as an idiom for obeying God\'s commands, heeding His instructions, and complying with His will. It signifies more than just hearing sound; it implies an active response of compliance. This is a very common biblical idiom.\n    *   **Decision:** Included as an idiom.\n\n3.  **כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם** ("just as I enjoin upon you this day"):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the comparison introduced by "כְּ" (ke-, "just as") constitutes a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a direct behavioral comparison, stating that their obedience should be *in accordance with* the commands given. It is a literal statement of equivalence or similarity in action, not a figurative simile.\n    *   **Decision:** Excluded as not figurative.\n\n4.  **אַתָּ֣ה וּבָנֶ֔יךָ** ("you and your children"):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "children" might be a synecdoche for all future descendants.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While the covenant has intergenerational implications, the phrase "you and your children" in this immediate context refers literally to the current generation being addressed and their direct offspring. Its broader implication for future generations is a contextual extension rather than a figurative device within the phrase itself.\n    *   **Decision:** Excluded as not figurative.\n\n5.  **בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ** ("with all your heart and soul"):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "heart and soul" refer to the literal physical organs or if they are a figurative expression for the entirety of one\'s being.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, "לב" (lev, heart) and "נפש" (nefesh, soul/life/self) are not used to refer to the physical organs in this context. Instead, "לב" represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, and "נפש" refers to the entire animating principle, the self, or one\'s life force. The phrase "with all your heart and all your soul" is a merism or a well-established idiom signifying total, undivided commitment, encompassing one\'s entire inner and outer being. It is not a literal reference to physical body parts.\n    *   **Decision:** Included as an idiom.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

The literal components, "return" (שׁוּב) and "captivity/returning" (שְׁבוּת), do not directly sum up to "restore fortunes" or "reverse captivity" in a purely literal sense.\n    *   Reasoning for inclusion: This construction, שׁוּב שְׁבוּת (or הֵשִׁיב שְׁבוּת), is a well-established and frequently used biblical idiom. It signifies the reversal of a state of exile, misfortune, or captivity, and the restoration of a people to their former prosperity, land, or favorable status. Its meaning is conventional and not simply the literal combination of its parts. The English note "fortunes Others \'captivity.\'" further highlights the idiomatic nature by showing the semantic range of the phrase beyond a single literal interpretation.\n    *   Decision: Mark as "idiom."\n\n2.  **וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ** (English: "and take you back in love." / "and he will have compassion on you.")\n    *   What I considered: I considered if the verb רָחַם (racham), meaning "to have compassion, show mercy, or love," is used figuratively here. The accompanying English note provides a rich cultural context, suggesting an "image of a (typically male) householder, who has the authority to determine the standing of his household’s members, especially as heirs," implying a restoration of standing.\n    *   Reasoning for exclusion: While the *implications* or *consequences* of God\'s compassion (רָחַם) might indeed lead to the restoration of the people\'s standing or their re-inclusion into a favored status, the verb itself primarily denotes a literal divine emotion and action of showing mercy or love. The note describes the *effect* of God\'s compassion within a specific cultural framework, rather than asserting that the verb *racham* itself is a metaphor for "restoring standing." Therefore, the use of רָחַם here is a literal description of God\'s merciful disposition and action.\n    *   Decision: Not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים** (English: "[God] will bring you together again from all the peoples")\n    *   What I considered: I considered if the verb וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ (v\'kibbetzcha), meaning "and he will gather you," is used metaphorically.\n    *   Reasoning for exclusion: "Gathering" is a literal action that God performs in the context of bringing scattered people back from exile.

The phrase functions as a set expression to convey the utmost extent of dispersion or extreme remoteness. It is a variant of the more common "ends of the earth" (קְצֵה הָאָרֶץ), both serving as idiomatic expressions for the furthest possible distance. The underlying figurative mechanism within this idiom is hyperbole, as it exaggerates the physical extent.

It emphasizes the vastness of the dispersion and God\'s ability to reach them no matter how far.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I debated whether to classify this as "hyperbole" or "idiom."

I have analyzed every phrase and concept in the provided Hebrew text and its English translation for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the given guidelines.

1.  **"וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ" (And your God יהוה will bring you):** I considered whether "God will bring you" constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. However, the guidelines explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." The act of "bringing" (הֵבִיא) is a divine action, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, according to the instructions, this is to be interpreted literally as God's direct action and is not marked as figurative.

2.  **"אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ" (to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it):** This phrase describes a literal geographical location (the land) and the literal act of possession, both by the ancestors and the future generation. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic expression present. This is a straightforward historical and future-oriented statement.

3.  **"וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥" (and [God] will make you more prosperous):** This describes a divine promise of blessing, resulting in a state of increased well-being or prosperity. It is a direct statement of God's benevolent action and its literal outcome. No figurative language is identified here.

4.  **"וְהִרְבְּךָ֖" (and more numerous):** Similar to "make you more prosperous," this is a direct divine promise of a literal increase in population or numbers. It is a literal statement of God's blessing.

5.  **"מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ" (than your ancestors):** This phrase introduces a comparison of degree, indicating that the prosperity and numerousness will exceed that of their ancestors. The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This comparison falls directly under this exclusion. It is a literal statement of quantitative and qualitative superiority, not a figurative simile or metaphor.

In conclusion, after careful examination of each component against the provided criteria, I find no elements in this verse that qualify as figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, or idiom) according to the specific and conservative guidelines. The divine actions are literal anthropomorphisms, and the comparison is explicitly excluded from being marked as figurative.

2025-09-21 12:12:01,371 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Metaphor - The text uses the physical act of circumcision, a known practice in the ANE context, as a metaphor to describe the spiritual transformation of the heart.  The heart is not literally circumcised; rather, the image conveys the idea of a deep, transformative change in one's inner being, a removal of spiritual "uncircumcision" (resistance to God). This is a clear cross-domain transfer from the physical to the spiritual realm.

Circumcision is a physical ritual performed on the foreskin.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: Applying a physical act like circumcision to an abstract concept like the "heart" (which represents the inner person, will, intellect, and emotions in biblical thought) is a clear cross-domain comparison. It signifies a spiritual transformation, a removal of spiritual impurity or resistance, enabling a deeper capacity for love and obedience to God. This is not a literal physical act on the heart. The English translation "open up" attempts to convey the metaphorical meaning but obscures the original Hebrew\'s vivid imagery. This is a classic biblical metaphor for spiritual purification and transformation.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None. This is a widely recognized metaphor in biblical studies.\n\n2.  **"לְבָבְךָ֖" (your heart) and "לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ" (the hearts of your offspring)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered whether the use of "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) to refer to the inner person (will, intellect, emotions) is figurative (e.g., metonymy or synecdoche).\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While "heart" is not the literal physical organ in this context, its use to denote the inner self is a very common and conventional expression in biblical Hebrew. It functions as standard narrative language for the seat of human thought, emotion, and will. It is not a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparison" in itself, but rather a conventional understanding of the term. Therefore, I am not marking "heart" in isolation as figurative. However, it serves as the *tenor* for the metaphor of "circumcising the heart."\n\n3.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖" (with all your heart and soul)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered whether this phrase is hyperbole or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: This is a well-established and frequently repeated phrase in the Deuteronomic tradition (e.g., Deuteronomy 6:5). It is a set phrase that signifies complete, total, and wholehearted devotion and commitment. It is not meant to be taken as a literal measurement of the physical heart and soul, but rather as an expression of the totality of one\'s being. As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None. This is a clear biblical idiom.\n\n4.  **"לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ" (in order that you may live)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered whether "live" (חַיֶּֽיךָ) here refers exclusively to physical life or also encompasses spiritual life, potentially making it figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While "life" in biblical theology often has profound spiritual dimensions, in the context of the covenant and its blessings/curses, "living" often refers to a full, prosperous, and long life in the land, as opposed to premature death or exile. It is a direct, literal consequence of obedience within the covenant framework. It does not involve a clear cross-domain comparison or personification. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

The act of "giving" or "inflicting" curses is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific physical body part.

There is no cross-domain comparison or substitution of a related concept for the curses themselves.\n\n3.  **עַל־אֹיְבֶ֥יךָ וְעַל־שֹׂנְאֶ֖יךָ (upon your enemies and upon your foes):**\n    *   **Considered:** If the preposition "עַל" (upon) or the terms "enemies" and "foes" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "עַל" is a standard preposition indicating direction or target. "Enemies" and "foes" are literal descriptions of people who oppose or persecute. There is no figurative meaning here.\n\n4.  **אֲשֶׁ֥ר רְדָפֽוּךָ (who persecuted you):**\n    *   **Considered:** If "persecuted" (רְדָפֽוּךָ) could be a metaphor for a less direct form of harm.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb רָדַף (radaph) literally means "to pursue," "to chase," and by extension, "to persecute" or "to oppress." In this context, it describes a direct and literal action of hostility and oppression. There is no indication of a figurative meaning; it describes the actual behavior of the enemies.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a conservative analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, hyperbole, metonymy) is present in this verse.

2025-09-21 12:12:40,441 - INFO -       VALIDATION PASSED: Divine Anthropomorphism (but not a metaphor in the ANE context).  While the phrase uses figurative language in the sense that God doesn't have a literal voice,  the concept of God communicating through a voice-like manifestation is a standard convention in ANE literature and understood literally within that context.  It's not a metaphor comparing God's communication to something else; it's a description of divine communication using anthropomorphic language.

The concept of "returning" (שוב) is physically rooted in movement, but here it refers to a spiritual or moral reorientation.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding it:** While "return" is used in a non-physical sense, this usage is highly conventionalized in biblical Hebrew for spiritual repentance or turning back to God. It functions as a standard theological term rather than a fresh, striking cross-domain comparison. The instructions emphasize being conservative with "standard narrative language" and marking "clear metaphors." This usage of "שוב" is so common and established that it functions more as a literal description of a spiritual action within the biblical worldview, akin to how "seeing" can mean "understanding" without being a fresh metaphor. It is not considered a "clear metaphor" in the sense of a novel or surprising comparison.\n\n2.  **Phrase: וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה (and you will hear/heed the voice of YHWH)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" (b\'qol YHWH, "the voice of YHWH") is a literal anthropomorphism, a metaphor, or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for including it:** The instructions explicitly state that "Biblical idions and set phrases (e.g. ... פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה) - these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." "קול יהוה" (qol YHWH) functions identically to "פי יהוה" (pi YHWH, "mouth of YHWH") in referring to divine communication, command, or revelation, rather than a literal vocal sound emanating from a physical mouth. While God is depicted as speaking, the "voice" itself is not a literal physical sound in the human sense, nor does God possess a physical vocal apparatus. It is a well-established, conventionalized phrase to denote God\'s word or command. Therefore, it is best classified as an idiom. It is not a literal anthropomorphism of God\'s body (which the instructions say to treat literally unless it refers to God\'s body part, but "voice" is not a body part in the same way "finger" is, and the instruction specifically points to "mouth of YHWH" as an idiom).\n\n3.  **Phrase: וְעָשִׂ֙יתָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֔יו (and you will do all His commandments)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "doing commandments" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding it:** This is straightforward, literal language describing the act of obeying divine instructions. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or other figurative element present.\n\n4.  **Phrase: אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם (which I enjoin upon you this day)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "enjoin upon you" or "command you" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding it:** This is literal language describing the act of giving a command or instruction. No figurative elements are present.\n\n**Borderline cases debated:** The primary borderline case was "וְאַתָּ֣ה תָשׁ֔וּב" (you will return/heed). While "returning" to God is a metaphorical extension of physical return, the instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE" and to only "MARK clear metaphors" led me to exclude it. The spiritual meaning of "שוב" is so deeply ingrained and conventionalized in biblical Hebrew that it functions more as a literal description of a spiritual state or action within that theological framework, rather than a fresh, striking metaphor.

However, the verb הוֹתִיר (Hiphil of יתר) literally means "to cause to remain over, to leave over, to have a surplus," which directly translates to "abounding prosperity" in this context. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **בְּכֹ֣ל׀ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֗ךָ** (in all your undertakings / in all the work of your hand): I considered if "work of your hand" might be a metonymy or synecdoche, where the "hand" (part/instrument) stands for the "person\'s effort/undertaking" (whole/action). This is a very common idiom in biblical Hebrew to refer to one\'s labor, efforts, or endeavors. Following the instructions to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, I have marked this as figurative.\n\n3.  **בִּפְרִ֨י בִטְנְךָ֜** (in your issue from the womb / in the fruit of your womb): I considered this as a potential metaphor. "Fruit" (פרי) primarily refers to the produce of plants. Applying it to human offspring from the "womb" (בטן) is a clear cross-domain comparison, likening children to the natural, desired produce of a plant. This is a well-established metaphor in Hebrew. Therefore, I have marked this as a metaphor.\n\n4.  **וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛** (the offspring of your cattle / and in the fruit of your cattle): Similar to the previous phrase, I considered this as a metaphor. "Fruit" (פרי) is again used to describe the offspring of animals (בהמה). While "fruit" can broadly mean "produce," its primary association is botanical. Applying it to animal offspring is an extension of this botanical metaphor, drawing a parallel between the desired produce of plants and the desired offspring of livestock. Therefore, I have marked this as a metaphor.\n\n5.  **וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖** (and your produce from the soil / and in the fruit of your ground): I considered if "fruit of your ground" might be figurative. However, "פרי" (fruit/produce) in relation to "אדמה" (ground/soil) is its literal and primary meaning, referring to agricultural yield. There is no figurative language here.\n\n6.  **לְטֹבָ֑ה** (for good / for well-being): This is a literal statement of purpose or outcome. Not figurative.\n\n7.  **כִּ֣י׀ יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב** (For יהוה will again delight in your well-being / For יהוה will return to rejoice over you for good):\n    *   "יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה" (יהוה will return): This is a divine anthropomorphism, implying a change in God\'s state or action. According to the instructions, divine anthropomorphisms are to be treated as LITERAL unless they refer to God\'s body. Therefore, this is not marked as figurative.\n    *   "לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙" (to rejoice over you / delight in you): This attributes human emotion (rejoicing, delight) to God.

It signifies an active response and submission to the speaker\'s will. The guidelines explicitly state to mark biblical idioms as figurative.

The root פלא (p.l.a) can mean "to be wonderful, extraordinary, difficult, incomprehensible."\n    *   **Reasoning**: In this context, "not baffling" or "not difficult" is a direct statement about the inherent quality of the instruction regarding its comprehensibility or ease of understanding for the people. It does not attribute a human-like quality to the instruction itself (e.g., the instruction *feeling* baffled), nor does it compare the instruction to something else that is baffling.

It does not possess physical location or spatial dimensions. Therefore, it cannot be literally "far away" in a geographical or physical sense. The use of a spatial term like "far away" (רְחֹקָה) to describe the *accessibility*, *attainability*, or *comprehensibility* of an abstract concept constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison. The physical distance (vehicle) is used to represent conceptual or practical accessibility (tenor). This is a metaphor. The English translation "beyond reach" effectively captures this figurative sense, as "reach" implies physical extension. This is a clear and common metaphorical usage in biblical Hebrew to describe the proximity or accessibility of divine wisdom or commands.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

This is a literal denial of its physical location. The "heavens" here refers to the literal celestial realm, which is physically high and beyond human reach.

For humans, this action is indeed impossible without divine intervention or advanced technology (which is not the context here). The rhetorical question emphasizes the *literal impossibility* of such a task for humans, rather than exaggerating a possible one. It\'s a literal description of a hypothetical, impossible scenario, used to highlight the accessibility of the commandment.

The subsequent rhetorical question "Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea?" reinforces the idea of a physical, albeit challenging, journey. The point being made is that the commandment is *not* located in such a physically inaccessible place.

In the context of the verse, if someone were to physically cross the sea, they would literally "get" or "bring" the commandment back.

However, in the context of divine instruction or commandments, it functions as a well-established idiom for proclaiming, announcing, teaching, or imparting knowledge/instruction. The physical act of "hearing" (or causing to hear) stands metonymically for the reception, comprehension, and assimilation of the message. It\'s not merely about sound waves, but about the communication of content that leads to understanding and potential action. This is a clear case of an idiom where a physical sense represents a cognitive or communicative process.

Therefore, "close to you" is presented as the literal opposite of these far-off locations, emphasizing the *accessibility* and *reachability* of the commandment. While the "thing" (the commandment) is abstract, its accessibility is described in literal spatial terms, meaning it is not physically or conceptually distant or difficult to obtain.

In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral decision-making, not merely a biological organ.

"Ways" (דְרָכִים) in this context does not refer to physical roads or paths that God literally walks on, but rather to God\'s character, principles, commands, and moral conduct. "To walk" (הָלַךְ) signifies living one\'s life according to these principles, following them, and imitating them. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where physical movement along a path is used to represent moral and ethical adherence and a way of life. It functions as a conventionalized metaphor, thus classified as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** While very common, the underlying meaning is clearly figurative, using a physical action and concept to describe abstract moral and ethical adherence.

They are direct descriptions of desired states of well-being and population growth, not metaphors for something else.

It is a direct act of divine favor and provision, not a metaphor. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n7.  **Phrase/Concept:** בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ (in the land that you are about to enter and possess)\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "land," "enter," or "possess" are figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are all literal geographical references and literal actions of physical movement and legal/military acquisition.

The original classification of metonymy is incorrect because metonymy uses an associated concept to represent something else (e.g., "the White House announced..." where the White House stands for the US government).  Here, a part ('soil') represents the whole ('land'), which is the definition of synecdoche.

However, "this day" is a common and literal temporal marker in biblical Hebrew, used to specify the time of a statement or event. It functions as a straightforward indication of when the declaration is being made. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵד֑וּן** (you shall certainly perish / you shall utterly perish): I considered if this infinitive absolute construction, which intensifies the verb "to perish," could be classified as hyperbole due to its strong emphasis. However, this is a standard grammatical feature in biblical Hebrew used to convey certainty or intensity of action, rather than an exaggeration beyond literal possibility. It literally means "perish, you shall perish" or "you shall utterly perish," indicating a definite and complete destruction. It is a literal statement of a dire consequence. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n3.  **לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙** (you shall not long endure / you shall not lengthen days): I considered if "to lengthen days" (תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙) is a metaphor for living long or an idiom. This phrase is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew, consistently used to mean "to live long" or "to endure for a long time." The literal concept of physically "lengthening" units of time (days) is not intended; rather, it refers to the duration of one\'s life or presence. As per the guidelines, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom." Therefore, I included it as an idiom.\n\n4.  **עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה** (on the soil / on the land): I considered if "the soil" (הָאֲדָמָה) might be a metonymy or synecdoche for the entire "land" or "territory." In this context, where the Israelites are about to "cross the Jordan to enter and possess" it, "הָאֲדָמָה" clearly refers to the geographical region or country of Canaan, not merely the physical dirt or ground. Using a part (the soil) to represent the whole (the land/territory) is a classic example of synecdoche, which is a type of metonymy. Therefore, I included it as metonymy.\n\n5.  **אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹבֵר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן** (that you are crossing the Jordan): I considered if "crossing the Jordan" could be a metaphor for a significant transition or a point of no return. However, in its immediate context, it describes a literal geographical action—the physical act of traversing the Jordan River to enter a new territory. It is a factual description of their movement. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n6.  **לָב֥וֹא שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ** (to enter and possess it): I considered if "to enter and possess" could be a metaphor for taking control or establishing dominance in a broader, non-literal sense. However, these verbs describe the literal actions of entering a physical territory and taking ownership and control of it through conquest and settlement. Therefore, I excluded them as figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

Heaven and earth, as non-human entities, cannot literally perform these actions.

However, in this context, the objects being "put before" the audience are "life and death, blessing and curse"—abstract concepts, not tangible items. Therefore, the phrase is not describing a literal physical action but rather the act of presenting choices or options for consideration. This is a common biblical idiom for offering a decision or path. It fits the criteria for an idiom as a "set phrase" that conveys a meaning beyond the literal sum of its parts in this specific context.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: One might argue for a literal interpretation if "life and death" were seen as metaphorical paths, but the phrase itself, when applied to abstract choices, functions as a conventional expression for "presenting options." Given the instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, this fits.\n\n3.  **"הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙ ... הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה" (life and death, blessing and curse)**\n    *   **Considered**: If these terms are metonymy for the *paths* or *consequences* associated with them.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While these terms represent outcomes or choices that lead to certain states, the words themselves (life, death, blessing, curse) are used literally to denote those states or concepts. The text is directly presenting these as the fundamental options. There isn\'t a substitution of an associated concept for the concept itself in a figurative way; rather, the concepts themselves are the direct objects of choice. Therefore, these are not considered figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None.\n\n4.  **"וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ" (Choose life—if you and your offspring would live—)**\n    *   **Considered**: If "choose life" is a figurative command.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a direct imperative to choose the state of "life," which inherently implies choosing the actions and covenantal obedience that lead to that state.

1.  **לְאַֽהֲבָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ** (loving your God יהוה): I considered whether "loving God" might be a metaphor for obedience or devotion. However, "love" (אהבה) is a literal human emotion and action, even when directed towards God. While it carries strong covenantal implications of loyalty and obedience in the biblical context, the act of loving itself is not a figurative representation of something else. It is a direct command for an internal disposition and its external manifestations. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.

2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice): I considered if "God's voice" (קֹל) here is a metonymy for God's commands or word. The phrase "to listen to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "to obey X" or "to heed X's instructions/words." While God does not possess a physical vocal apparatus in the human sense, the concept of divine communication and human response is fundamental. This is a conventional, idiomatic expression for obedience to divine instruction, not a metaphor or a literal physical act of hearing. As per the guidelines, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom." Therefore, I have included it as an idiom.

3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him): I considered whether "cleaving to God" is a metaphor for spiritual or covenantal attachment. The verb דבק (dabaq) literally means to stick, cling, or adhere physically. When applied to God, it clearly transcends a physical act. Instead, it describes an intense, unwavering spiritual, emotional, and covenantal attachment, loyalty, and devotion. This constitutes a cross-domain comparison where physical adhesion (the vehicle) is used to describe a non-physical, relational commitment (the tenor). This is a clear metaphor. Therefore, I have included it as a metaphor.

4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For He is your life): I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor. The statement directly identifies God (or the relationship with God, as implied by the preceding context of loving, obeying, and cleaving) with "life." This is not a literal assertion that God *is* the biological process of life, but rather that God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of true, meaningful, and enduring life. It is a direct metaphorical identification where God is the tenor, and "life" (in its fullest, most profound sense) is the vehicle, signifying that true existence and vitality are found in Him. Therefore, I have included it as a metaphor.

5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and the length of your days): This phrase is parallel to the preceding "He is your life," with the implied "He is" applying to it as well ("He is... the length of your days"). I considered this as a potential metaphor. While "length of days" (אורך ימים) is a common biblical expression for longevity and a full lifespan, the direct identification "He *is* the length of your days" is metaphorical. It means that God is the ultimate source and giver of a long and prosperous life. Similar to "He is your life," this is a metaphorical identification of God as the essence and source of longevity. Therefore, I have included it as a metaphor.

6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (to dwell upon the soil): This is a literal description of residing in a specific geographical location (the land). It is not figurative. Therefore, I have excluded it.

7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם** (that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them): I considered "נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה" (יהוה swore) as a potential divine anthropomorphism. According to the guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms are considered literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body. Swearing is an act of speech and oath-making, which is presented as a literal action for God in biblical narrative and does not refer to a specific body part. The rest of the phrase provides literal historical and genealogical information. Therefore, I have excluded this as figurative.
