The phrase בוא על (bo\' al) is a standard idiom meaning "to come upon," "to happen to," or "to befall" someone, especially concerning events or circumstances. This is a common and literal way to describe events occurring to an individual or group. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or attribute human qualities to inanimate objects in a figurative sense.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n2.  **הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה** ("the blessing and the curse")\n    *   **Considered:** If "blessing" and "curse" are used metonymically to represent the *outcomes* or *effects* of blessing and cursing.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While blessing and curse are abstract concepts, their use here directly refers to the categories of divine favor and disfavor, which encompass their associated outcomes. This is a direct and standard way of referring to these concepts in the biblical context, not a substitution where one entity stands in for another in a non-obvious or indirect manner. The text explicitly states "all these things... the blessing and the curse," indicating these are the overarching categories of "things" that will occur.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ** ("that I have set before you")\n    *   **Considered:** The phrase לְפָנֶיךָ ("before your face" or "before you") in conjunction with נָתַתִּי ("I have given/set").\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a well-established biblical idiom. "To set/give before someone" (נתן לפני) is not a literal physical act of placing objects in front of a person\'s face. Instead, it signifies the act of presenting options, choices, or consequences for consideration and decision. It is a fixed expression conveying the idea of making something available or visible for a choice to be made.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Figurative (Idiom).\n\n4.  **וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ** ("and you take them to heart")\n    *   **Considered:** The phrase אֶל־לְבָבֶךָ ("to your heart") with the verb וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ ("and you will return/bring back").\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a common biblical idiom. "To bring back to the heart" or "to set on the heart" (שוב אל לב, שים על לב) means "to take to heart," "to consider deeply," "to reflect upon," or "to remember." In biblical anthropology, the heart (לֵב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, not merely a physical organ. Therefore, bringing something "to the heart" is a figurative expression for engaging with it mentally and emotionally, not a literal physical action.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Figurative (Idiom).\n\n5.  **בְּכׇ֨ל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה** ("amidst the various nations to which your God יהוה has banished you")\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "God has banished you" (הִדִּיחֲךָ יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ) is an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** According to the instructions, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." God\'s act of banishing is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, it is considered a literal action within the ANE context of the text. The "nations" and the act of "banishing" are literal descriptions of historical/prophetic events.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies a spiritual and moral turning, not a physical movement. Therefore, it functions as an idiom for spiritual repentance and renewal of the covenant.\n    *   **Decision:** Included as an idiom.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ** (and you heed God’s command / listen to His voice)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "listen to His voice" might be a literal auditory perception of God\'s physical voice.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While God can speak audibly, in many biblical contexts, "listening to the voice" (שמע בקול) is a standard idiom for obeying, heeding, or complying with a command or instruction. It refers to the act of obedience to God\'s word or will, rather than merely the physical act of hearing a sound. This is a common biblical idiom for obedience.\n    *   **Decision:** Included as an idiom.\n\n3.  **כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם** (just as I enjoin upon you this day)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the comparison "just as I enjoin upon you" might be a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instruction explicitly states, "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a direct behavioral comparison, indicating that their obedience should align with the speaker\'s (Moses\') current command. It is a literal statement of equivalence in action or instruction, not a figurative simile.\n    *   **Decision:** Excluded as not figurative.\n\n4.  **אַתָּ֣ה וּבָנֶ֔יךָ** (you and your children)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "you and your children" might be a synecdoche for all future generations.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While it certainly implies future generations, it is also a literal reference to the immediate audience and their direct descendants. In a narrative context, this is standard language for addressing a community and its lineage. It\'s not a figurative substitution but a direct address to the family unit and its continuity.\n    *   **Decision:** Excluded as not figurative.\n\n5.  **בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ** (with all your heart and soul)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "heart and soul" might be literal physical organs or if the phrase is a metaphor or metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, "heart" (לבב) and "soul" (נפש) are not merely physical organs but represent the totality of one\'s inner being, including intellect, will, emotions, and life force. To act "with all your heart and soul" is a deeply ingrained biblical idiom signifying complete, undivided, and wholehearted devotion, commitment, and sincerity. It is not a literal action performed by the physical heart or soul, but a comprehensive expression of one\'s entire inner self.\n    *   **Decision:** Included as an idiom.', 'fallback_used': False}

2025-09-21 12:55:21,831 - ERROR - Invalid JSON response: DELIBERATION:

I have analyzed every phrase in the provided text for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the given guidelines for a conservative approach to narrative text and divine anthropomorphisms.

1.  **וְשָׁ֨ב יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ֖ (then your God יהוה will restore your fortunes):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the phrase הֵשִׁיב שְׁבוּת (heishiv shvut), translated as "restore your fortunes" (or "restore your captivity"), might be a metaphor, metonymy, or an idiom.
    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase הֵשִׁיב שְׁבוּת is a well-recognized and frequently occurring idiom in biblical Hebrew. It does not literally mean to "return a captivity" as if captivity were a physical object to be brought back. Instead, it signifies a comprehensive reversal of a state of misfortune, exile, or decline, leading to restoration, well-being, and prosperity. The meaning of the whole phrase is not deducible from the literal meanings of its individual words ("return" and "captivity/returning"). This perfectly aligns with the definition of an idiom. The instructions explicitly state to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type.
    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom.

2.  **וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ (and take you back in love / and have compassion on you):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if God "taking back in love" or "having compassion" could be figurative, especially given the English note's elaboration about a "householder" image.
    *   **Reasoning:** The Hebrew verb רחם (racham) directly means "to have compassion, show mercy, love." While compassion and love are abstract concepts, God's expression of these emotions and the actions stemming from them are presented as direct and literal divine attributes and behaviors within the biblical narrative. The instruction states to be conservative with "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." God's compassion is an anthropomorphism of emotion, which falls under this category and is generally understood as a literal divine attribute. The English note's explanation about the "householder" image describes the *implications* or *cultural context* of God's compassion and restoration, but the verb רחם itself is not a metaphor or simile.
    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.

3.  **וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים (and [God] will bring you together again from all the peoples):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "gather you from all the peoples" might be figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This describes a literal, physical action of bringing dispersed people back to a central location. "Gathering" is a direct action, and "peoples" refers to literal nations. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended.
    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.

4.  **אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (where your God יהוה has scattered you):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "scattered you" might be figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to "gathering," "scattering" (הפיץ, hefitz) describes a literal, physical action of dispersing people across different locations. While it implies a state of exile and disunity, the verb itself denotes a direct, physical act.
    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.

Based on this deliberation, only one instance of figurative language (an idiom) was identified.

However, "outcasts" directly refers to the people who have been driven out or dispersed. It is a literal description of their status, not a figurative stand-in for something else. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" (at the ends of the sky/heavens/world)**: I considered this phrase for hyperbole and idiom. "The ends of the sky" (קְצֵה הַשָּׁמָיִם) is not a literal, geographically reachable point. In ancient Near Eastern cosmology, while the sky was conceived as an expanse, "its ends" represent the uttermost, most remote, and virtually unreachable limits of the known world or beyond. This expression is a clear exaggeration (hyperbole) to convey extreme distance and dispersion. It functions as an idiom for "the ends of the earth" or "the furthest reaches of the world." Therefore, I have included this as both hyperbole and idiom.\n\n3.  **"מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" (from there your God יהוה will gather you)**: I considered if "God will gather you" constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. The guidelines state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Gathering" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. In the ANE worldview, God\'s actions were often described in human-like terms but understood as literal divine interventions. Therefore, following the guidelines, this is considered a literal divine action and not marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **"וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ" (from there [God] will fetch you)**: Similar to the previous phrase, I considered if "God will fetch you" (literally "take you") is a figurative anthropomorphism. "Fetching" or "taking" is an action, not a reference to a divine body part. Consistent with the guidelines, this is understood as a literal divine action in the ANE context. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\nIn summary, the only genuinely figurative element identified, based on the provided conservative guidelines, is the phrase "בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" due to its hyperbolic and idiomatic nature.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

I have analyzed every potential figurative element in this verse according to the provided guidelines.

1.  **וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ** (And your God יהוה will bring you to the land):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "God will bring you" might be a figurative expression, perhaps a metaphor for divine guidance or a metonymy for God's agents.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct statement of divine action. The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body." God's act of bringing or leading people is a standard, literal anthropomorphic action in biblical narrative, not referring to a specific body part. Therefore, it is understood as a literal divine act.

2.  **אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ** (that your fathers possessed):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "fathers possessed" could be figurative, perhaps implying a spiritual inheritance rather than physical.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward historical statement about the physical possession of land by ancestors. There is no indication of a non-literal meaning. It falls under "Historical and genealogical information" which should be treated conservatively and literally.

3.  **וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ** (and you shall possess it):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "you shall possess it" might be a figurative promise, perhaps of spiritual dominion.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct, literal promise of future physical possession of the land, consistent with the covenant promises throughout the Hebrew Bible. It is standard narrative language.

4.  **וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥** (and [God] will make you more prosperous):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "God will make you prosperous" might be a metaphor for spiritual well-being or a hyperbolic statement.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct statement of divine blessing, referring to material and general well-being. God's role in bestowing prosperity is a literal theological concept and a direct divine action, not a metaphor or hyperbole in this context.

5.  **וְהִרְבְּךָ֖** (and [God] will make you more numerous):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "God will make you numerous" might be a metaphor for influence or a hyperbolic statement.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct statement of divine blessing, referring to population growth. God's promise to multiply descendants is a recurring, literal theme in the biblical narrative (e.g., Genesis 12:2, 15:5). It is a direct divine action and standard narrative language.

6.  **מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** (than your ancestors):
    *   **Considered:** I considered if the comparison "more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors" might be a form of hyperbole or a figurative simile.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This phrase is a direct proportional comparison, indicating a quantitative increase relative to previous generations. It is a literal statement of degree, not a figurative simile or hyperbole.

**Conclusion:** After a thorough examination of each phrase against the provided guidelines, I find no instances of clear metaphors, personification, obvious similes, or biblical idioms in this verse. The language used is direct, literal, and consistent with standard narrative descriptions of divine action, historical facts, and future promises.

Applying this verb to the "heart" (לֵבָב), which in biblical Hebrew represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotions, is a clear cross-domain comparison. It is not a literal physical operation on the organ. This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom (e.g., Deut 10:16, Jer 4:4) signifying a spiritual transformation, the removal of spiritual hardness or resistance, making the heart receptive and obedient to God\'s commands. It functions as a metaphor where the spiritual impediment to loving God is implicitly compared to the foreskin that is removed in physical circumcision. The accompanying English footnote ("open up*open up Others “circumcise.”") further highlights the non-literal, interpretive nature of the phrase.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark as metaphor and idiom.\n\n2.  **לְבָבְךָ֖ / your heart**:\n    *   **Considered**: Metonymy (specifically synecdoche, where a part represents the whole).\n    *   **Reasoning**: In biblical Hebrew, "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is the standard conceptualization for the inner person, encompassing intellect, will, and emotions. It is not merely the physical organ but the center of one\'s being. This is a primary and direct meaning in the ANE context, not a figurative substitution or comparison in itself. While it is the object of the figurative "circumcision," "heart" on its own, when referring to the inner person, is considered standard narrative language and not a fresh figurative device according to the conservative guidelines.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative on its own.\n\n3.  **וְאֶת־לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ / and the hearts of your offspring**:\n    *   **Considered**: Metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The reasoning is identical to that for "your heart" above. "Hearts" here refers to the inner being/will of the descendants, which is a standard conceptualization in biblical Hebrew, not a figurative usage in isolation.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n4.  **בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ / with all your heart**:\n    *   **Considered**: Hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This phrase is a common expression of totality and complete devotion in biblical Hebrew. While it emphasizes the extent of one\'s love, it is a standard idiom for wholeheartedness, not an exaggeration intended to be understood as literally impossible or over-the-top. It conveys sincerity and completeness rather than an unrealistic claim.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n5.  **וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ / and all your soul**:\n    *   **Considered**: Hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning**: Similar to "with all your heart," "with all your soul" (נֶפֶשׁ, referring to one\'s entire being, life-force, or self) is a standard expression for complete devotion and commitment.

The verb נָתַן (natan) typically means "to give," "to place," or "to put."\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** Curses (אָלוֹת) are abstract concepts, not physical objects that can be literally "given" or handed over. Therefore, the verb נָתַן is used here in a non-literal, extended sense. This usage is conventionalized in biblical Hebrew to express God\'s act of causing curses to befall someone or bringing them into effect. This conventional, non-literal application of a concrete verb to an abstract concept qualifies it as an **idiom**. Furthermore, because it involves applying the concrete action of "giving" (typically associated with physical objects or human interaction) to an abstract, non-physical entity ("curses"), it also functions as a **metaphor** (a cross-domain comparison). While the instruction notes that divine anthropomorphisms are generally literal, this specific phrasing goes beyond a simple literal action. God *does* cause curses, but the *expression* "gives curses" is figurative, akin to "mouth of the sword" or "face of the ground" which are explicitly listed as idioms. The instruction to "classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type" takes precedence here, as the non-literal nature of "giving" an abstract curse makes it inherently figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases/debates:** The primary debate was reconciling the instruction to treat "divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)" with the instruction to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases... as \'idiom\' type." While "God will give" is an anthropomorphism of action, the *object* of the giving (curses) is abstract, rendering the act of "giving" non-literal in a physical sense. The meaning "to cause to happen" is an idiomatic extension of "to give." I concluded that while God\'s agency in causing curses is literal, the *expression* used to describe this agency is idiomatic and metaphorical, thus falling under the "MARK AS FIGURATIVE" category for idioms and metaphors.\n\n2.  **"עַל־אֹיְבֶ֥יךָ וְעַל־שֹׂנְאֶ֖יךָ" (upon your enemies and upon your foes):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the preposition עַל ("upon") used with "enemies and foes" might be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is standard, literal language. Curses are directed *at* or *against* individuals, and "upon" accurately conveys this direction or target. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר רְדָפֽוּךָ" (who persecuted you):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the verb רְדָפֽוּךָ ("pursued," "chased," "persecuted") might be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of the enemies\' hostile actions towards the people. The English "persecuted" captures the hostile intent of the pursuit. No figurative language is present.', 'fallback_used': False}

While "תָשׁוּב" often carries significant theological weight implying repentance or a change of heart, in this context, it describes a direct change in behavior and allegiance back towards God\'s commands. It is a standard, non-figurative description of renewed obedience or a change in direction. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or personification. Consistent with the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language, this is not marked as figurative.\n*   **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will listen to the voice of YHWH): I considered if "ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" (voice of YHWH) is an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

However, the verb describes a literal state of excess or abundance, which is a direct promise of blessing. It is a factual description of the extent of the blessing, not an exaggeration for rhetorical effect. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **בְּכֹ֣ל׀ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֗ךָ** (in all your undertakings / in all the work of your hand): I considered if "work of your hand" might be a metonymy or synecdoche, where the "hand" (a part) represents the entire "undertaking" or "labor" (the whole). This is a very common and fixed expression in biblical Hebrew. My reasoning for including it as figurative is that it functions as a well-established biblical idiom. The "hand" is not literally the entirety of the "work" or "undertaking," but rather the instrument or symbol of the person\'s effort and activity. The guidelines explicitly state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Furthermore, it is a clear example of metonymy (specifically synecdoche).\n\n3.  **בִּפְרִ֨י בִטְנְךָ֜** (in your issue from the womb / in the fruit of your womb): I considered if "fruit of your womb" might be a metaphor, comparing children to the produce of a plant. While the term "fruit" (פרי) is indeed used metaphorically for offspring, this specific phrase is a highly conventionalized and fixed expression in biblical Hebrew for human children. My reasoning for including it as figurative is that it functions as a biblical idiom. Although its origin is metaphorical (children as "fruit" of the body), its common usage makes it a fixed idiom for "offspring" or "children." The guidelines state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and also to mark clear metaphors. Since the metaphorical comparison is evident in the origin of the idiom, it is both an idiom and a metaphor.\n\n4.  **וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛** (the offspring of your cattle / and in the fruit of your cattle): I considered if "fruit of your cattle" might be a metaphor, similar to "fruit of the womb." However, the Hebrew word "פרי" (p\'ri) has a broader semantic range than just botanical fruit; it also directly means "produce" or "offspring." Therefore, "פרי בהמתך" can be understood literally as "offspring of your cattle" without requiring a metaphorical interpretation. It is a direct and common way to refer to animal young. Thus, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖ לְטֹבָ֑ה** (and your produce from the soil / and in the fruit of your ground for good): I considered if "fruit of your ground" might be figurative. However, "פרי אדמתך" literally means "produce of your ground/soil." This is the direct and literal meaning of the term. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n6.  **כִּ֣י׀ יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב** (For יהוה will again delight in your well-being / For יהוה will return to rejoice over you for good): I considered if "יהוה will rejoice" (יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ) constitutes personification or anthropomorphism. The guidelines explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "rejoicing" refers to an emotion and not a physical body part of God, it is to be treated as a literal statement within the ANE context as per the instructions. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n7.  **כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** (as in that of your ancestors / as he rejoiced over your ancestors): I considered if the comparison "as he rejoiced over your ancestors" (כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ) constitutes a simile. However, the guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a behavioral comparison, stating that God\'s future rejoicing will be *like* his past rejoicing over the ancestors. It is a literal statement of equivalence or similarity in behavior, not a figurative simile. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

It means "to obey," "to heed," or "to listen to and act upon" the speaker\'s words or commands. It implies compliance and submission to authority. Therefore, it functions as an idiom for obedience rather than a literal description of hearing a sound.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark as "idiom".\n\n2.  **"לִשְׁמֹ֤ר מִצְוֺתָיו֙ וְחֻקֹּתָ֔יו" (lishmor mitzvotav v\'ḥuqotav) / "and keeping the divine commandments and laws"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the act of "keeping commandments and laws" could be interpreted figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning**: "Keeping" (שמר) in this context refers to the literal actions of observing, obeying, or guarding the divine decrees.

To act "with all your heart" is an idiom expressing total inner commitment, sincerity, and devotion.

To act "with all your soul" is an idiom, often paired with "heart," to emphasize total commitment, encompassing one\'s entire being, one\'s very life force, and one\'s deepest desires. It is not a literal, separable "soul" in a modern philosophical sense, but the totality of one\'s existence and vitality. This phrase, especially in conjunction with "heart," forms a comprehensive idiom for complete devotion. This is also a form of synecdoche (a type of metonymy) where "soul" represents the entire person or one\'s life.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark as "idiom" and "metonymy".\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, describing it as "not far" is a clear instance of figurative language. It employs a spatial term (distance) to convey an abstract quality: the instruction\'s accessibility, attainability, and comprehensibility. It means the instruction is not difficult to understand or perform, and it is within the grasp of the people.

The statement "not in the heavens" is a literal denial of the commandment\'s physical location. The broader context of Deuteronomy 30:11-14 emphasizes the *physical accessibility* of the commandment, contrasting it with physically impossible journeys (to the heavens or across the sea). The point is that the commandment is not *physically* located in a place that would make it inaccessible. Therefore, this is a literal statement about location and accessibility, not a figurative one.\n\n2.  **"מִ֣י יַעֲלֶה־לָּ֤נוּ הַשָּׁמַ֙יְמָה֙" / "Who among us can go up to the heavens"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "go up to the heavens" might be a metaphor for an impossible task or a hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While physically ascending to the heavens is indeed impossible for humans, the phrase describes a literal, albeit hypothetical and impossible, physical action. The "heavens" are still understood as a literal, physical realm. The rhetorical question emphasizes the *literal impossibility* of such a journey, thereby highlighting the *literal accessibility* of the commandment. It\'s a rhetorical device to underscore a literal truth (the commandment is near), rather than a figurative description of the commandment itself or the act of seeking it. The impossibility is literal, not a cross-domain comparison or exaggeration beyond what is literally being described. It\'s a statement about a physically impossible action, not a figurative representation of something else.\n\n3.  **"וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ" / "and get it for us"**:\n    *   **Considered**: This is a straightforward, literal action of acquiring something.

"Beyond the sea" is a literal geographical descriptor for a very distant place. The statement is a literal negation, asserting that the commandment is *not* located in such a remote, physically challenging-to-reach location. While the implication is that it\'s not difficult to access, the language used to convey this is a literal reference to physical distance, not a figurative comparison or exaggeration. It\'s standard narrative language describing location.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n2.  **מִ֣י יַעֲבׇר־לָ֜נוּ אֶל־עֵ֤בֶר הַיָּם֙ / Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea:**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "cross to the other side of the sea" (יַעֲבׇר־לָ֜נוּ אֶל־עֵ֤בֶר הַיָּם֙) might be a figurative expression for undertaking an impossible or extremely arduous task.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase directly follows and elaborates on the previous one. If the commandment *were* beyond the sea, then the action required would be to literally cross the sea. The question is rhetorical, emphasizing the impracticality and difficulty of such a literal journey, but the action of "crossing the sea" itself remains a literal physical act. The rhetorical nature of the question does not transform the literal action into a figurative one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ / and get it for us:**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "get it" (וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ) could be a metonymy or metaphor for understanding or acquiring knowledge of the commandment.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb לקח (laqach) means "to take" or "to get." In the context of retrieving something (the commandment) from a distant, inaccessible place (beyond the sea), "getting it" refers to the literal act of retrieval, as one would retrieve a physical object or a message. While the ultimate purpose is to understand and observe the commandment, the act described here is a literal physical acquisition from a remote location.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְיַשְׁמִעֵ֥נוּ אֹתָ֖הּ / and impart it to us (literally: and cause us to hear it):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "cause us to hear it" (וְיַשְׁמִעֵ֥נוּ אֹתָ֖הּ) might be an idiom for teaching, proclaiming, or communicating the commandment.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Hiphil form of שׁמע (shama\', "to hear") is השמיע (hishmia\'), meaning "to cause to hear," "to announce," "to proclaim," or "to impart." In the context of divine instruction or a commandment, "causing someone to hear it" is the standard, literal, and direct way to describe its communication or promulgation. It is not a cross-domain comparison, nor does its meaning deviate from the literal function of the verb in this context. It is standard narrative language for communication.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה / that we may observe it (literally: and we will do it):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "do it" (וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה) could be an idiom for obeying or observing a commandment.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb עשׂה (asah) means "to do," "to make," "to perform." When referring to a commandment (מצוה), "doing it" is the most direct and literal way to express obedience or observance. It is not a specialized idiom where the meaning is significantly different from the literal action; rather, it is the straightforward and common terminology for fulfilling a commandment. It is standard religious vocabulary, not a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\nBased on this thorough analysis, I find no instances of figurative language in this verse according to the provided guidelines.', 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, "in your mouth" functions as a metonymy, where the physical organ (mouth) stands for its primary function of verbal expression.

The "thing" (the commandment/Torah) is not a physical object that can be literally placed inside the heart organ. In biblical anthropology, the heart (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral decision-making. Therefore, "in your heart" functions as a metonymy, where the physical organ (heart) stands for its cognitive and volitional functions.

Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative language.\n\n2.  **נָתַ֤תִּי לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ (natati l\'faneykha) - I set before you:** I considered whether this phrase describes a literal physical action or constitutes a figurative idiom. The Hebrew "לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" literally means "before your face." When combined with the verb "נָתַ֤תִּי" (I gave/set), the phrase "נָתַ֤תִּי לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" is a very common biblical idiom. It extends the literal act of placing something physically in front of someone to the figurative act of presenting choices, options, or instructions for consideration. This usage is a well-established set phrase in biblical Hebrew, signifying accessibility and the act of making something available for decision. According to the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, I have included this as an idiom.\n\n3.  **הַיּ֔וֹם (hayyom) - this day:** I considered if this temporal marker carried any symbolic or extended meaning beyond its literal reference to the current day. I found no evidence of figurative usage; it functions as a straightforward indicator of time. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative language.\n\n4.  **אֶת־הַֽחַיִּ֖ים וְאֶת־הַטּ֑וֹב (et ha-chayyim v\'et ha-tov) - life and prosperity:** I considered if these abstract concepts were being used metonymically to represent the *paths* or *actions* that lead to them. However, in this context, "life" and "prosperity" are presented as the direct *outcomes* or *states* that are being offered as one side of a fundamental choice. There is no clear cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or obvious simile. The text is directly stating the results of a choice. Therefore, I have excluded this as figurative language.\n\n5.  **וְאֶת־הַמָּ֖וֶת וְאֶת־הָרָֽע (v\'et ha-mavet v\'et ha-ra) - death and adversity:** Similar to the previous phrase, I considered if these abstract concepts were metonymic for the *paths* or *actions* that lead to them. For the same reasons as "life and prosperity," these are presented as the direct *outcomes* or *states* that constitute the other side of the choice. There is no clear figurative device at play. Therefore, I have excluded this as figurative language.', 'fallback_used': False}

My reasoning for excluding it is that it is standard, literal narrative and legal language, indicating a direct divine command given at a specific time. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.\n\n2.  **"to love your God יהוה" (לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙)**: I considered if "love" here might be used in a metaphorical or idiomatic sense beyond its literal meaning of affection and devotion. My reasoning for excluding it is that "love" (אַהֲבָה) for God, while encompassing obedience and loyalty in the biblical context, is understood as a literal, albeit profound, emotional and volitional state. It is not a metaphor for something else, nor is it an idiom in this context.\n\n3.  **"to walk in God’s ways" (לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו)**: I considered if this phrase should be interpreted literally as a physical act of walking on a path belonging to God, or figuratively. My reasoning for including it as figurative language is that "walking in X\'s ways" (הָלַךְ בְּדֶרֶךְ X) is a very common and well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew. It consistently refers to one\'s conduct, lifestyle, or adherence to a set of principles, rather than physical locomotion. The "ways" (דְּרָכָיו) of God are not literal roads or paths, but rather His moral character, commands, and statutes. Therefore, "walking in God\'s ways" is a metaphorical expression for living according to God\'s will and commandments. It functions as an idiom because it is a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning derived from its constituent words, representing a cross-domain comparison where physical movement (vehicle) represents moral conduct (tenor). This is a clear case of both an idiom and a metaphor.\n\n4.  **"and to keep God’s commandments, God’s laws, and God’s rules" (וְלִשְׁמֹ֛ר מִצְוֺתָ֥יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֖יו וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֑יו)**: I considered if "to keep" (שָׁמַר) or the various terms for divine statutes might be figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that "to keep" is used literally in the sense of observing, obeying, or guarding. The commandments, laws, and rules are literal divine instructions. This is standard legal and theological language, not figurative.\n\n5.  **"that you may thrive and increase" (וְחָיִ֣יתָ וְרָבִ֔יתָ)**: I considered if "thrive" (חָיָה) and "increase" (רָבָה) might be used hyperbolically or metaphorically. My reasoning for excluding it is that these are literal outcomes and blessings promised for obedience, referring to physical well-being, longevity, and population growth. They are not exaggerated beyond literal possibility or used to represent something else.\n\n6.  **"and that your God יהוה may bless you" (וּבֵֽרַכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ)**: I considered if "bless" (בָּרַךְ) is figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that divine blessing is a literal action of God, bestowing favor, prosperity, and well-being. It is a standard theological concept and not a metaphor or idiom in this context. As per instructions, divine anthropomorphisms (like God blessing) are literal unless referring to God\'s body.\n\n7.  **"in the land that you are about to enter and possess" (בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ)**: I considered if "land," "enter," or "possess" might be figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that these terms refer to a literal geographical location and literal actions of conquest and settlement. This is standard narrative and historical language.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only "to walk in God’s ways" is identified as genuinely figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, its use here is a **metonymy**, where the part (the heart) stands for the whole (the person\'s inner disposition, will, or allegiance). The action of "turning away" (יִפְנֶ֥ה) is not a literal physical rotation of the organ but an idiom describing a change in loyalty, intention, or moral direction. This phrase functions as a well-established **idiom** in biblical Hebrew for apostasy or a shift in one\'s inner commitment. While there\'s a subtle element of personification in attributing the action of "turning" to the heart, the primary figurative devices are metonymy and idiom, as per the guidelines to classify biblical idioms as such.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The subtle personification was considered, but the dominant figurative function is metonymy and idiom, which are more direct and common interpretations in this context.\n\n2.  **Phrase: וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע (and you give no heed / do not listen)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "to listen" (תִשְׁמָ֑ע) is meant literally as auditory perception or figuratively as "to obey" or "to heed."\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb שמע (shama\') in biblical Hebrew frequently extends beyond mere auditory perception to encompass the meaning of "to obey," "to heed," or "to pay attention and act accordingly," especially in the context of divine commands or warnings. Therefore, "not to listen" (וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע) is an **idiom** signifying a failure to obey or to heed the divine instruction, rather than a literal inability to hear. This aligns with the guideline to classify biblical idioms as figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None.

In this context, it describes the consequence of the heart turning away – being led astray from the covenant or the right path towards other gods. This is a direct description of a spiritual/moral state or action, not a figurative comparison.

It refers to the present moment of speech. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an established idiom that replaces its literal meaning. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **כִּ֥י אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵד֑וּן** (that you shall certainly perish)\n    *   Considered: Whether the infinitive absolute construction אָבֹד תֹּאבֵדוּן (lit. "perishing you shall perish") constitutes hyperbole or an idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a standard grammatical construction in Hebrew used for emphatic assertion or certainty. It intensifies the verb\'s meaning ("you shall utterly perish," "you shall certainly perish") but does not describe the act of perishing in a non-literal or exaggerated way that goes beyond the bounds of what is literally possible or intended. It is a grammatical device for emphasis, not a figurative device like metaphor or hyperbole that alters the literal meaning or presents an impossible scenario. It is not an idiom in the sense of a fixed phrase whose meaning is not deducible from its individual words. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙** (you shall not long endure / lit. you shall not lengthen days)\n    *   Considered: Whether "lengthen days" (תַאֲרִיכֻן יָמִים) is a literal description or a figurative idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "to live long" or "to endure for a long time." The days themselves are not literally stretched or made longer; rather, the duration of one\'s life or presence is extended. This is a classic example of a set phrase where the literal meaning of the individual words ("lengthen" + "days") does not directly convey the intended meaning of "live long." This fits the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type.\n    *   Decision: Marked as figurative (idiom).\n\n4.  **עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה** (on the soil / on the land)\n    *   Considered: Whether "the soil" (הָאֲדָמָה) is used literally or metonymically for the broader concept of "the land" or "territory."\n    *   Reasoning: While "אֲדָמָה" literally means "ground" or "soil," in contexts concerning possession, inheritance, and dwelling, it frequently functions as a metonymy for the entire "land" or "territory." Here, the statement is about enduring *in* the land, not merely *on* its surface soil. The soil (a part) stands for the land (the whole). This is a common metonymic usage in biblical Hebrew, functioning as a conventionalized set phrase or idiom. The instruction to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type, and metonymy being a type of figurative language, supports this classification.\n    *   Decision: Marked as figurative (metonymy and idiom).\n\n5.  **אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹבֵר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן לָב֥וֹא שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ** (that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it)\n    *   Considered: Whether "crossing the Jordan," "to enter," or "to possess" contain any figurative elements.\n    *   Reasoning: These phrases describe literal physical actions and intentions related to the geographical feature (the Jordan River) and the land.

When used with abstract concepts like "life and death" or "blessing and curse," it signifies the act of presenting choices, options, or consequences for consideration, rather than a literal physical placement of objects. The speaker is not literally placing physical items in front of the audience.\n    *   **Reasoning for "life and death, blessing and curse"**: These terms represent the ultimate abstract outcomes or states resulting from choices. While they are abstract, they are not being used metaphorically or metonymically *for something else*. "Life" refers to a state of flourishing and existence, and "death" to its opposite. "Blessing" and "curse" refer to divine pronouncements and their resulting states. The terms themselves are the direct referents of the choice, not figurative representations of other concepts. The figurative element lies in the *idiomatic expression* of presenting these choices.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark the entire phrase "I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse" as an idiom, as the act of "putting before" these abstract concepts is idiomatic for presenting choices.\n\n3.  **"Choose life—if you and your offspring would live" (וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ)**\n    *   **Considered**: Whether "life" (חַיִּים) is used figuratively in "choose life" or "would live."\n    *   **Reasoning**: In this covenantal context, "life" refers to a state of flourishing, well-being, and continued existence, which is the desired outcome of obedience to God\'s commands.

1.  **"לְאַֽהֲבָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" (loving your God יהוה)**: I considered if "loving God" could be interpreted figuratively, perhaps as a metonymy for obedience or a metaphor for devotion. However, "love" (אהבה) in Hebrew, while encompassing actions and loyalty, fundamentally refers to an emotional and volitional state. It is a direct command for a specific relationship and attitude, not a figurative representation of something else. Therefore, I conclude it is literal.

2.  **"לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ" (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice)**: I considered if "listening to His voice" (שמע בקולו) is a literal act of hearing sound or a figurative expression. In biblical Hebrew, "שמע בקול" is a well-established idiom meaning "to obey" or "to heed" someone's instructions or commands, rather than merely perceiving auditory vibrations. The "voice" (קול) here functions metonymically to represent the spoken word or command, and "hearing" (שמע) implies compliance. This is a clear biblical idiom.

3.  **"וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ" (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him)**: I considered if "cleaving/holding fast" (דבק) to God is a literal physical act or a metaphor. While "דבק" can describe physical adhesion (e.g., skin cleaving to bones, Genesis 2:24), when applied to a non-physical entity like God, it clearly transcends the physical realm. It signifies a deep, unwavering spiritual and emotional attachment, loyalty, and commitment. One cannot physically "cling" to God in the same way one clings to a person or object. This is a clear metaphor.

4.  **"כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙ וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ" (For He is your life and the length of your days)**: I considered if God is literally "life" and "length of days." This is a strong statement of identification. God is not the abstract concept of "life" itself, nor is He the temporal duration of "length of days." Instead, He is the ultimate source, giver, and sustainer of life and longevity. The statement equates God with these benefits, implying that these benefits are found *in* Him or *through* Him. This is a direct metaphorical identification.

5.  **"לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה" (to dwell upon the soil / to live in the land)**: I considered if "dwelling upon the soil" is figurative. This phrase literally describes the act of inhabiting a physical territory. There is no hidden meaning or cross-domain comparison. It is a straightforward description of living in a particular land. Therefore, I conclude it is literal.

6.  **"אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ" (that יהוה swore to your fathers)**: I considered if "God swore" is figurative. The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." "Swearing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a physical body part. Therefore, according to the provided guidelines, this is to be treated as a literal divine action within the ANE worldview.
