This usage is so conventional and pervasive that it functions as a standard idiom for the experience or occurrence of something. It does not present the "things" as having human-like agency (which would be personification) nor does it create a novel, cross-domain comparison characteristic of a metaphor. Instead, it\'s a conventional linguistic shortcut. Therefore, I classify this as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was a borderline case between a very subtle personification/metaphor and a conventional idiom. My decision leans towards idiom due to the high frequency and conventional nature of this construction in biblical Hebrew for the occurrence of events, rather than a fresh, imaginative comparison.\n\n2.  **Phrase: הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ (asher natati l\'faneikha) - "that I have set before you"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "setting before you" might be a literal action or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ (natati l\'faneikha), literally "I have given before your face," is a well-established biblical idiom. It signifies the act of presenting options, choices, or consequences for consideration, rather than a literal physical placement of the blessing and curse as tangible objects in front of a person. It refers to the declaration of covenantal choices or the presentation of outcomes. As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a clear and widely recognized idiom.\n\n3.  **Phrase: וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ (va-hasheivota el-l\'vavekha) - "and you take them to heart" / "and you return to your heart"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "taking to heart" or "returning to your heart" might be a metaphor or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew thought, the heart (לֵב/לֵבָב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and inner being, encompassing thought and decision, not solely emotion. The phrase "to return to one\'s heart" or "to take to heart" is a common idiom signifying deep reflection, consideration, internalization, or remembering. It does not describe a literal physical action of moving something into the organ of the heart, nor is it a cross-domain comparison. It is a conventional expression for a cognitive and volitional process. As per the instructions, this is an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a clear and widely recognized idiom.\n\n4.  **Phrase: אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (asher hidikha YHWH Eloheikha shammah) - "to which your God יהוה has banished you there"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "YHWH has banished you" might be figurative, specifically an anthropomorphism.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Banishing" (הִדִּיחֲךָ) is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a physical body part. In the Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context, such divine actions are understood as literal interventions and decrees by God. Therefore, this is considered a literal statement of divine action, not figurative language.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None, given the explicit guidelines provided for divine anthropomorphisms.', 'fallback_used': False}

I also considered if it could be a standard theological term that has lost its figurative force.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** While שוב can denote physical return, in the context of "returning to God," it clearly signifies repentance, a change in moral or spiritual orientation, or a renewal of covenantal relationship. This is a cross-domain mapping where the physical act of returning to a place or person is used to describe a non-physical, spiritual reorientation. Therefore, it functions as a metaphor. It\'s not a literal physical movement towards God.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a very common and clear metaphorical usage in biblical Hebrew for repentance.\n\n2.  **"וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ" (and you heed God’s command / listen to His voice)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "listening to His voice" is a literal act of hearing a sound produced by God, or if "voice" (קול) is used figuratively to represent God\'s command or word. I also considered if it\'s an anthropomorphism.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This is a classic biblical idiom. "To listen to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) almost invariably means "to obey X" or "to heed X\'s command/word," rather than merely perceiving an auditory phenomenon. The "voice" (קול) here metonymically stands for the message, command, or instruction conveyed. While "voice" is a bodily function, the instruction explicitly states to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and this phrase fits that description perfectly, similar to "mouth of YHWH." The figurative force lies in the metonymic use of "voice" for "command," making "idiom" and "metonymy" the most appropriate classifications.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I debated whether to classify "God\'s voice" as an anthropomorphism. However, the instruction prioritizes "idiom" for set phrases like "mouth of YHWH," and "listening to the voice" is a very similar idiomatic expression for obedience.\n\n3.  **"כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם" (just as I enjoin upon you this day)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the comparative particle "כְּ" (as, just as) makes this a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a direct, literal comparison of how the action should be performed ("according to all that I command you"). It describes the standard or measure of obedience, not a figurative likeness.\n\n4.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖" (with all your heart)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "heart" (לבב) refers to the physical organ or is used figuratively to represent the inner being, will, intellect, or emotions.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** In biblical Hebrew, "heart" (לב/לבב) is consistently used metonymically to denote the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral character, rather than the physical organ. To act "with all your heart" is an idiom signifying complete devotion, sincerity, and inner commitment. It\'s a metonymy where the physical organ represents the totality of one\'s inner self.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a fundamental and clear figurative usage in biblical Hebrew.\n\n5.  **"וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ" (and with all your soul)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "soul" (נפש) refers to a distinct spiritual entity separate from the body, or if it is used figuratively to represent the entire living being, life force, or deepest self.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** Similar to "heart," "soul" (נפש) in this context is used metonymically to represent the entirety of one\'s being, one\'s life, or one\'s deepest desires and vitality. To act "with all your soul" is an idiom emphasizing complete dedication and commitment of one\'s entire self. It\'s a metonymy where a part (life force/essence) stands for the whole person.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a fundamental and clear figurative usage in biblical Hebrew, often paired with "heart" to emphasize totality.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

1.  **Phrase/Concept: וְשָׁ֨ב יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ֖ / יהוה your God will restore your fortunes**
    *   **What was considered:** I considered whether the phrase "restore your fortunes" (specifically the Hebrew construction שׁוּב שְׁבוּת, here rendered as וְשָׁ֨ב...אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ֖) constitutes a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom.
    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The Hebrew phrase שׁוּב שְׁבוּת is a classic example of a biblical idiom, a cognate accusative construction. While literally meaning "to return a returning" or "to return a captivity," its established and specialized meaning is "to restore fortunes," "to reverse a state of misfortune," or "to bring back from exile/captivity." It functions as a fixed expression with a meaning that transcends the literal sum of its individual words. The instructions explicitly state: "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as 'idiom' type." This phrase perfectly fits that description.
    *   **Borderline cases debated:** I debated whether to also classify this as metonymy, as "captivity" (שְׁבוּת) could be seen as metonymically representing the broader state of exile, misfortune, or loss of status. However, given the explicit instruction to classify such fixed phrases as "idiom," and considering that the idiomatic nature is the most prominent feature of this construction, "idiom" is the most direct and accurate classification. The conceptual shift is inherent to the idiom itself.

2.  **Phrase/Concept: וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ / and take you back in love / and have compassion on you**
    *   **What was considered:** I considered whether God's act of "having compassion" or "taking back in love" (from the verb רחם) is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The verb רחם (racham) directly describes God's emotional and volitional action of showing compassion or mercy. According to the instructions, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body." God having compassion is an anthropomorphism of emotion, not a reference to a physical body part. Therefore, it is treated as a literal description of God's attribute and action.

3.  **Phrase/Concept: וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים / [God] will bring you together again from all the peoples**
    *   **What was considered:** I considered whether the action of "bringing together again" or "gathering" (וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙) is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** "Gathering" people from various locations is a literal action. There is no clear cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification of an inanimate object, or obvious simile present. This is a direct description of God's action of reassembling the dispersed people.

4.  **Phrase/Concept: אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה / where your God יהוה has scattered you**
    *   **What was considered:** I considered whether the action of "scattering" (הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛) is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** "Scattering" people, particularly in the context of exile or dispersion among nations, is a literal action. This is a direct description of God's action in judgment, which will then be reversed by the gathering.

I have analyzed the provided Hebrew text, "אִם־יִהְיֶ֥ה נִֽדַּחֲךָ֖ בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ" (Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world,*world Lit. “sky.” from there your God יהוה will gather you, from there [God] will fetch you), for figurative language according to the provided guidelines.

1.  **"נִֽדַּחֲךָ֖" (your outcasts):** I considered if this term might be a metonymy for the entire nation or people of Israel. However, "outcasts" (those who are driven out or scattered) is a direct and literal description of the status of the people in exile. It accurately identifies the specific group being addressed. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.

2.  **"בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" (at the ends of the sky/heavens):** This phrase was the primary candidate for figurative language.
    *   I considered if it was a literal geographical location. Given that the "ends of the sky" is not a physically reachable or definable boundary on Earth, a literal interpretation is not plausible.
    *   I considered if it was a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom. While it functions as a set phrase to denote extreme distance, its primary figurative mechanism is exaggeration. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), nor is it a part standing for a whole or an attribute for the thing itself (metonymy).
    *   I concluded that this phrase is a clear example of **hyperbole**. It exaggerates the vastness of the dispersion of the exiles, implying they could be scattered to the furthest conceivable reaches of the known world, beyond any literal geographical limit. The "sky" (שָׁמַיִם) here represents the furthest visible horizon, symbolizing ultimate distance. This exaggeration serves to emphasize God's omnipotence and ability to gather them from *any* distance, no matter how extreme.

3.  **"יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" (your God יהוה will gather you):**
    *   I considered if the verb "gather" (קָבַץ) was used figuratively. However, "gathering" is a literal action of bringing scattered people or things together. In the context of exile, it refers to the literal act of reassembling the dispersed community.
    *   I also considered the divine anthropomorphism inherent in "God will gather you." According to the instructions, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." "Gathering" is an action, not a reference to God's physical body. Therefore, this is to be understood literally within the ANE context.

4.  **"וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ" (and from there [God] will fetch you):**
    *   Similar to "gather," I considered if "fetch" (לָקַח) was figurative. This verb means to take, bring, or receive, and in this context, it is synonymous with "gather," referring to the literal action of bringing the exiles back.
    *   The divine anthropomorphism "God will fetch you" is also considered literal based on the provided guidelines, as it describes an action and not a part of God's body.

Based on this deliberation, only "בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" is identified as genuinely figurative language, specifically hyperbole.

I have analyzed every potential figurative element in the provided verse according to the given instructions.

1.  **וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ (And your God יהוה will bring you):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether "God will bring" constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." The act of "bringing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, in this context, it is considered a literal divine action and not figurative.

2.  **אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ (to the land that your fathers possessed):**
    *   **Considered:** This phrase describes a historical or promised event regarding land possession.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is standard narrative language conveying historical information and a future promise. There are no cross-domain comparisons, personification, or obvious similes present. It is a literal statement.

3.  **וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ (and you shall possess it):**
    *   **Considered:** This is a direct promise of future possession.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal statement of a future action or promise. No figurative language is detected.

4.  **וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥ (and [God] will make you more prosperous):**
    *   **Considered:** This is a promise of blessing and well-being.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal promise of material and existential improvement. It does not involve any figurative devices like metaphor or personification.

5.  **וְהִרְבְּךָ֖ (and more numerous):**
    *   **Considered:** This is a promise of population growth, a common covenant blessing.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal promise of an increase in numbers. No figurative language is present.

6.  **מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ (than your ancestors):**
    *   **Considered:** Whether the comparison "more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors" should be marked as figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state, "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This phrase is a direct proportional comparison indicating a greater degree of prosperity and numerousness. Therefore, it is to be treated as a literal comparison and not figurative.

**Conclusion:**
Based on a thorough analysis of each phrase and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, hyperbole, metonymy, or specified idioms) is found in this verse. Divine anthropomorphisms are to be taken literally, and proportional comparisons are explicitly excluded from being marked as figurative.

The verb מול (mul) literally means "to circumcise," a physical act performed on the foreskin.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: Applying the physical act of circumcision to an internal organ like the "heart" (לֵבָב), which in biblical Hebrew represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotions, is not a literal possibility. This constitutes a clear **metaphor**, where the physical cutting away of the foreskin (vehicle) symbolizes the spiritual removal of hardness, stubbornness, or resistance to God\'s will (tenor). It signifies a profound inner transformation that enables love for God. Furthermore, "circumcision of the heart" is a well-established **biblical idiom** or set phrase used to describe this spiritual change, making it a figurative idiom as per the instructions. The action applies equally to "the hearts of your offspring" (לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ), extending the same figurative meaning.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None.

In Hebrew thought, "heart" often refers to the inner person, intellect, will, and emotions, and "soul" to the entire being or life force.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While "heart" and "soul" can technically be seen as metonymic for aspects of the inner person or one\'s entire being, the phrase "with all your heart and with all your soul" is a very common and standard biblical expression for expressing complete and total devotion. It functions as a conventional way to describe the *extent* of one\'s love and commitment, rather than a "clear metaphor," "obvious simile," or a *figurative* idiom in the same way "circumcise the heart" is. The instructions emphasize being conservative with standard narrative language and only classifying biblical idioms as "idiom" if they are *figurative* idioms. This phrase, while a set expression, is so fundamental to expressing totality that its figurative force is diminished, functioning almost literally as "with your entire being." Therefore, I am being conservative and not marking it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ" / "in order that you may live"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "live" (חַיֶּֽיךָ) here implies a figurative sense beyond mere physical existence, such as a blessed or abundant life.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While "life" in a biblical context often encompasses well-being, prosperity, and covenant blessings, this is a literal outcome of obedience and spiritual transformation.

Therefore, according to the guidelines, this is to be understood literally as God\'s direct action. Furthermore, while נָתַן with אָלוֹת is a common collocation, it is not an idiom in the sense of having a meaning that deviates from the literal combination of its parts. "To give/place curses" directly means to cause them to come upon someone.

While "שׁוּב" often carries spiritual connotations of repentance in the Bible, its primary meaning here is a direct, observable change in conduct. It is not a cross-domain comparison but a statement about a shift in the people\'s actions. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will heed/listen to the voice of יהוה): I considered if "בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" (the voice of YHWH) is figurative. This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom. While "voice" is an anthropomorphic attribute, in this context, it does not refer to a literal audible sound produced by a physical mouth, as God does not possess a physical body in the human sense. Instead, "the voice of YHWH" functions as a metonymy, where "voice" (an attribute of communication) stands for God\'s commands, instructions, or divine pronouncements. The instructions explicitly state to classify biblical idioms and set phrases like "פִּֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of YHWH) as "idiom."

However, this is a direct statement of divine blessing and a promise of abundance, which is a literal expectation within the covenant context, not an exaggeration for effect. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **בְּכֹ֣ל׀ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֗ךָ** (in all your undertakings / lit. "in all the work of your hand"): I considered if "work of your hand" (מַעֲשֵׂה יָדֶךָ) is a metonymy or idiom. The "hand" (יָד) is a part of the body used to perform work, and here it stands for the entire activity, labor, or efforts of a person. This is a classic example of synecdoche (a type of metonymy) where a part represents the whole, and it is a very common idiom in biblical Hebrew. Therefore, it is marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n3.  **בִּפְרִ֨י בִטְנְךָ֜** (in your issue from the womb / lit. "in the fruit of your womb"): I considered if "fruit of your womb" (פְרִי בִטְנְךָ) is a metaphor or idiom. Children are compared to "fruit" (פְרִי), which is typically the produce of a plant or tree. This is a cross-domain comparison, likening human offspring to agricultural produce, emphasizing fertility and blessing. It is also a well-established biblical idiom for children. Therefore, it is marked as figurative (metaphor, idiom).\n\n4.  **וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛** (the offspring of your cattle / lit. "the fruit of your cattle"): I considered if "fruit of your cattle" (פְרִי בְהֶמְתְּךָ) is a metaphor or idiom. Similar to "fruit of the womb," "fruit" (פְרִי) is used here to refer to the offspring of animals. This extends the plant-based metaphor of "fruit" to animal reproduction, signifying their produce or increase. It is a common biblical idiom. Therefore, it is marked as figurative (metaphor, idiom).\n\n5.  **וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖** (and your produce from the soil / lit. "and the fruit of your ground"): I considered if "fruit of your ground" (פְרִי אַדְמָתְךָ) is figurative. In this context, "fruit" (פְרִי) refers literally to the agricultural produce of the soil (אַדְמָה). This is the primary and literal meaning of "fruit" in relation to land. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n6.  **לְטֹבָ֑ה** (for well-being / for good): This is a standard adverbial phrase indicating a positive outcome. It is a literal statement. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n7.  **כִּ֣י׀ יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב** (For יהוה will again delight in your well-being / lit. "For יהוה will again rejoice over you for good"): I considered if "יהוה will again delight/rejoice" (יָשׁוּב יְהֹוָה לָשׂוּשׂ עָלֶיךָ) is personification or anthropomorphism. The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Attributing the emotion of "delight" or "rejoicing" to God is an anthropomorphism, but it does not refer to a physical body part. Following the specific instruction, this is considered literal in the ANE context. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n8.  **כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** (as in that of your ancestors / lit. "as he rejoiced over your ancestors"): I considered if this comparison is a simile. The instructions state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase compares God\'s future action/attitude (rejoicing over them) to His past action/attitude (rejoicing over their ancestors). This is a behavioral comparison, a literal statement of similarity in divine disposition, not a figurative simile involving a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

While God\'s voice can be audibly manifested, in contexts like this, where it\'s linked to "keeping commandments," it denotes a volitional act of submission to divine authority.

This is standard, literal language for adherence to laws or instructions. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an established idiom beyond its direct meaning of observance.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **Phrase: הַכְּתוּבָ֕ה בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֖ה הַזֶּ֑ה (hakkəṯûḇâ bəsēfer hattôrâ hazzéh) - "that are recorded in this book of the Teaching"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "recorded in this book" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal statement describing the physical act of writing and the location of the written laws within a book. No figurative language is present.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **Phrase: כִּ֤י תָשׁוּב֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ (kî tāšûḇ ʾel-YHWH ʾĕlōheykā) - "once you return to your God יהוה"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "return to God" implies a physical movement or a spiritual turning.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb "שׁוּב" (shuv) literally means "to turn" or "to return." However, in a theological context, especially when referring to one\'s relationship with God, it consistently carries the meaning of "repentance," "turning back" from sin or disobedience to a right relationship with God. It signifies a spiritual, moral, and relational turning, not a physical relocation. This is a fundamental and widely recognized theological idiom for repentance or spiritual restoration.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom.\n\n5.  **Phrase: בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ (bəḵol-ləḇāḇəḵā ûḇəḵol-nafšəḵā) - "with all your heart and soul"**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "heart and soul" is a literal reference to physical organs or a figurative expression for the totality of one\'s inner being and commitment.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, "לֵבָב" (levav - heart) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, and "נֶפֶשׁ" (nefesh - soul/life/self) refers to the entire person, life force, or inner self. The phrase "with all your heart and all your soul" is a well-established biblical idiom (often appearing with "might" or "strength" as well) signifying complete, undivided devotion, commitment, and the totality of one\'s inner being. It functions as a merism, using two significant components to represent the whole, thereby conveying absolute dedication rather than a literal physical action or state of these organs.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

"מִצְוָה" literally means "commandment" or "instruction," and "מְצַוְּךָ֖" is a direct description of Moses (or God through Moses) issuing these commands. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or established idiom present here. It is a literal statement about the nature and transmission of the law.\n\n2.  **"לֹא־נִפְלֵ֥את הִוא֙ מִמְּךָ֔" (is not too baffling for you):**\n    *   **Considered:** If "נִפְלֵאת" (nif\'let), meaning "wonderful," "difficult," "extraordinary," or "baffling," is used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The negative "לֹא־נִפְלֵאת" directly describes an inherent quality of the commandment: it is not extraordinarily difficult to understand or perform, nor is it beyond human capacity. While the English "baffling" might suggest a mental state, the Hebrew describes the objective nature of the instruction itself. It is a direct, literal assertion about the commandment\'s comprehensibility and achievability, not a comparison to something else. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְלֹ֥א רְחֹקָ֖ה הִֽוא" (nor is it beyond reach / nor is it far):**\n    *   **Considered:** If "רְחֹקָה" (reḥoqah), meaning "far" or "distant," is used literally or figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The subject of this statement is "הַמִּצְוָה" (the Instruction), which is an abstract concept or a body of laws. An instruction cannot possess physical distance in a literal sense. Therefore, stating that it is "not far" (לֹא רְחֹקָה) employs a cross-domain comparison. Physical distance (the vehicle) is used to represent conceptual, practical, or spiritual accessibility and achievability (the tenor). It means the instruction is not difficult to understand, not impossible to perform, and not beyond the people\'s grasp or reach. This constitutes a clear metaphor. Furthermore, this phrase is a well-established biblical idiom for something being readily available, understandable, or achievable (as seen, for example, in its quotation in Romans 10:6-8).

The "heavens" are presented as a literal, physical location that is extremely high and difficult for humans to reach. The subsequent rhetorical question, "Who among us can go up to the heavens...?", reinforces this literal understanding of a physical ascent to a distant place.

The impossibility is inherent in the literal act itself for a human being. The purpose of the rhetorical question is to emphasize that the commandment is *not* located in such an inaccessible place. It is not an exaggeration of a *possible* task, but a literal description of an *impossible* physical journey, used to highlight the commandment\'s accessibility by contrasting it with an extreme, unreachable location.

The statement asserts that the Law is *not* in these physically distant places. The concept of being "beyond the sea" is a literal geographical description, even if it implies great difficulty in reaching it.

The difficulty associated with such a journey is inherent in the literal act, especially in ancient times, but the language itself remains descriptive of a physical movement. The rhetorical question ("Who among us can cross...?") highlights the *impossibility* or *extreme difficulty* of the hypothetical task *if* the Law were located there, but the words describing the action are literal.

In the context of the Law, this is a direct and literal description of the process of oral instruction, proclamation, or making something known. While it implies the goal of understanding and obedience, the phrase itself describes the literal act of communication.

The "thing" (הַדָּבָר) refers to the commandment or the Torah.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: Commandments are not physical objects that can be spatially "close" or far. Therefore, "close" cannot be interpreted literally in a physical sense. Instead, it functions as a metaphor, comparing the ease with which the commandment can be understood, remembered, and performed to the physical proximity of an object that is readily at hand. It emphasizes that the divine instruction is not distant, obscure, or difficult to grasp. This is a clear cross-domain comparison.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None.

The mouth is the primary organ for speech and articulation. Therefore, "in your mouth" signifies that the commandment is known, spoken, declared, and readily available for teaching and recitation. This is a classic example of metonymy, where the body part stands for its associated function (speech, knowledge, declaration). Furthermore, such expressions are common in biblical Hebrew, functioning as established idioms.

In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, memory, and moral decision-making, not merely a blood-pumping organ. Thus, "in your heart" means that the commandment is understood, internalized, accepted, believed, and committed to. This is a clear metonymy, where the organ represents its associated cognitive and volitional functions. It is also a very common and established biblical idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: Similar to "in your mouth," its clear metonymic function is also encompassed by its status as a common biblical idiom.

It is a common rhetorical device to introduce an important statement, but it does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or a fixed idiomatic meaning beyond its literal sense of drawing attention.

It signifies the act of presenting options, choices, or a situation for someone\'s consideration. The instruction explicitly states that "biblical idioms and set phrases" should be classified as "idiom."

Instead, "walking" is a common biblical **metaphor** for one\'s conduct, lifestyle, or manner of living, and "ways" refers to God\'s principles, commands, or moral standards. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison where physical action (walking) represents moral conduct, and physical paths (ways) represent ethical guidelines.

There is no metaphorical extension, personification, or idiomatic usage that deviates from its direct meaning of adherence. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"וְחָיִ֣יתָ וְרָבִ֔יתָ" / "that you may thrive and increase"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "thrive" (חָיִיתָ) or "increase" (רָבִיתָ) could be hyperbole or metaphor for spiritual rather than physical prosperity.\n    *   **Reasoning**: These terms describe literal, tangible blessings of life, prosperity, and multiplication, which were highly valued and promised in the ancient Near East context as direct consequences of obedience. While they have spiritual implications, their primary meaning here is literal well-being and demographic growth. There is no exaggeration beyond what is expected as a blessing, nor a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n6.  **"וּבֵֽרַכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ" / "and that your God יהוה may bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "bless" (בֵּרַכְךָ) or "land" (בָּאָרֶץ) might be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning**: "Bless" refers to God\'s literal act of bestowing favor and prosperity.

When the text states the "heart turns away" (יִפְנֶה), it is not attributing a literal physical action of turning to the organ itself. Instead, it uses the "heart" as a metonym for the entire inner person\'s will, intention, or loyalty. The "turning away" signifies a change in moral or spiritual allegiance. This is a classic example of **metonymy** (specifically, synecdoche, where a part—the heart—represents the whole inner being or its disposition). Furthermore, this expression is a well-established **idiom** in biblical literature to describe a shift in loyalty or a departure from God\'s path. It is not personification because the action of "turning away" in this context is an action of the inner self, which the heart represents, rather than an action typically reserved for a human body part being attributed to an inanimate object. It is also not a metaphor in the sense of a direct cross-domain comparison, but rather a conventional way of expressing an internal state.\n    *   **Decision**: Classified as metonymy and idiom.\n\n2.  **"וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע" (and you give no heed / and do not listen)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "not listen" might be a literal auditory act or an idiom for disobedience.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: While "שמע" (shama\') can literally mean "to hear," in the context of divine commands, warnings, or covenant stipulations, it frequently carries the extended meaning of "to heed," "to obey," or "to pay attention with the intent to act." Therefore, "not listening" in this verse is not merely about failing to perceive sounds, but about failing to obey or respond appropriately to God\'s instructions or warnings. This is a very common and well-understood **idiom** in biblical Hebrew for disobedience or disregard.\n    *   **Decision**: Classified as idiom.\n\n3.  **"וְנִדַּחְתָּ֗" (and are lured / and you are driven away / led astray)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "lured" or "driven away" might be a metaphor for spiritual deception or a literal physical act.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verb נדח (nadach) means to drive away, banish, scatter, or lead astray. In this context, it describes being led astray spiritually or morally from the right path. While it\'s not a literal physical "luring" or "driving" in the sense of physical force, this is a standard semantic extension of the verb to the spiritual/moral domain. It directly describes the consequence of the heart turning away and not heeding. It is a direct description of being led astray, rather than a cross-domain comparison (metaphor) or attributing human qualities to an inanimate object (personification). It falls under standard narrative language describing a spiritual state or action.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n4.  **"וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֛יתָ לֵאלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים וַעֲבַדְתָּֽם" (and you worship and serve other gods)**\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "worship and serve" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: These phrases describe literal actions of religious devotion and service to other deities.

For instance, "this day" could potentially be a metonymy for a significant historical moment.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is standard, literal narrative language. "Declare" is a direct verb of communication, and "this day" is a straightforward temporal marker indicating when the declaration is made.

The consequence of "utterly perishing" is a literal and possible outcome of divine judgment within the biblical narrative. It describes a complete destruction or cessation of existence, which is presented as a direct and certain consequence, not an overstatement. Therefore, it is treated as an emphatic literal statement.\n\n3.  **"לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙" (you shall not long endure / you shall not lengthen days):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "lengthen days" (תַאֲרִיכֻן יָמִים) is a literal description of time or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a well-established biblical idiom. "Lengthening days" is not a literal physical manipulation of time, but a common Hebrew expression for living a long life, enduring, or having a prolonged existence in a particular place. It uses the concrete concept of extending "days" (a unit of time) as a vehicle to represent the abstract concept of longevity or continued presence. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n\n4.  **"עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה" (on the soil / on the land):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "the soil/land" (הָאֲדָמָה) could be a metonymy for the people inhabiting it or the nation itself.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "on the soil" refers directly to the physical ground or territory where the people would reside. The statement concerns their physical presence and duration *on* that specific land. It is a literal geographical reference, not standing in for something else.\n\n5.  **"אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹבֵר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן" (that you are crossing the Jordan):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "crossing the Jordan" could be a metaphor for a significant transition or a point of no return.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase describes a literal physical action of traversing the Jordan River. While the act of crossing the Jordan is historically and theologically significant, in this specific sentence, it functions as a literal geographical and historical marker for the land they are about to enter. It is not a figurative comparison or symbolic representation in itself.\n\n6.  **"לָב֥וֹא שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ" (to enter and possess it):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "enter" (לָבוֹא) or "possess" (לְרִשְׁתָּהּ) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These verbs describe literal actions of physical entry into a territory and taking ownership or control of it. They are direct and concrete actions within the narrative, without any figurative extension of meaning.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙" is identified as figurative language.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

This phrase attributes the human action of "witnessing" to non-human, inanimate entities.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In ancient Near Eastern (ANE) legal and covenant contexts, invoking cosmic elements like heaven and earth as witnesses was a common practice. While these entities are not sentient in a human sense, their invocation serves to solemnize the oath or covenant, emphasizing its gravity, permanence, and cosmic scope. This is a clear case of personification, as a human attribute (witnessing) is assigned to non-human entities. It is not a literal physical act of witnessing, but a symbolic one.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a standard example of personification in biblical literature.\n\n2.  **"I have put before you" (נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ) in "I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse"**\n    *   **Considered:** If the act of "putting before" abstract concepts like "life and death, blessing and curse" is literal.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ" (I have put before you) is a common Hebrew idiom used to present choices or options. It employs a spatial metaphor, treating abstract concepts as if they were tangible objects physically placed in front of someone for selection. The concepts themselves (life, death, blessing, curse) are literal options, but the *act* of "putting them before" is an idiomatic representation of presenting these choices.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a well-established idiomatic expression in Hebrew.\n\n3.  **"life" (בַּחַיִּ֔ים) in "Choose life" (וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "life" here refers solely to biological existence or something more.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "life" is presented as the opposite of "death" and is paired with "blessing" as opposed to "curse." Therefore, "choosing life" implies choosing the path of obedience and covenant faithfulness that leads not merely to biological existence, but to a flourishing, prosperous, and well-being-filled existence. This is a metonymy, where the outcome ("life" in its fullest sense) stands for the means to achieve it (obedience to God\'s commands) or where a part (biological existence) stands for the whole (a blessed, flourishing existence). It is also part of the broader idiomatic presentation of choices discussed above.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** While "life" can be understood literally as existence, the contrast with "death" and the pairing with "blessing" strongly suggest a qualitative aspect beyond mere biological survival, making it a clear metonymy for a flourishing existence tied to covenant obedience.\n\n4.  **"if you and your offspring would live" (לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "live" in this concluding phrase is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase refers to the desired outcome of choosing "life" (the metonymic path). Here, "live" (תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה) is used literally to mean continued existence and well-being, which is the direct consequence of choosing the path of "life."\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a literal statement of consequence.', 'fallback_used': False}

I have carefully analyzed the provided Hebrew text and its English translation for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the given guidelines.

1.  **לְאַֽהֲבָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ** (loving your God יהוה): I considered whether "loving God" could be interpreted figuratively. However, in the biblical context, this is a literal command for a genuine emotional and volitional disposition, expressed through obedience and devotion. It is not a cross-domain comparison or an indirect way of speaking about something else. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.

2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice): I considered if "listening to His voice" (שמע בקולו) is a literal auditory act or a figurative expression. The phrase "שמע בקול" is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "to obey," "to heed," or "to comply with." While it literally involves hearing, its primary semantic force in this context extends beyond mere auditory perception to active submission and obedience to God's commands. This falls under the "biblical idioms and set phrases" category, which should be classified as "idiom."

3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him): I considered whether "cleaving to Him" or "holding fast to Him" (דבקה בו) is a literal physical act or a figurative expression. While the root דבק (d-b-q) can describe physical adhesion (e.g., skin cleaving to bones), in the context of one's relationship with God, it clearly refers to spiritual, emotional, and covenantal loyalty, devotion, and unwavering adherence to God's ways. This is a cross-domain comparison where a physical action (cleaving/adhering) is used to describe an abstract, spiritual relationship. Therefore, I have identified this as a metaphor.

4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For He is your life): I considered this phrase for metaphorical meaning. God is not literally the biological process or state of being alive. Instead, this statement equates God with the source, essence, and sustainer of true, meaningful life. It is a direct identification of God (the vehicle) with "life" (the tenor) to convey His absolute centrality and vital importance. This is a clear metaphor involving a cross-domain comparison.

5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and the length of your days / He is the length of your days): This phrase is syntactically parallel to the preceding "הוא חייך" (He is your life), meaning the "הוא" (He is) applies to both. Thus, it implies "He is the length of your days." While "length of days" can be a literal blessing of longevity, the *identification* of God *as* the length of one's days is metaphorical. God is not literally a duration of time, but rather the source and guarantor of that longevity. This is a metaphor, similar to "He is your life," emphasizing God's role as the ultimate provider and embodiment of a long and prosperous existence.

6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (to dwell upon the soil / to live in the land): I considered if "dwelling upon the soil/land" is figurative. This is a literal description of residing in a physical territory. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.

7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ** (that יהוה swore to your fathers): I considered "יהוה swore" (נשבע יהוה). According to the instructions, divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body. Swearing is an action attributed to God, not a body part. Therefore, I have treated this as a literal anthropomorphism and excluded it as figurative.

In summary, I have identified one idiom and three metaphors in this verse, all with high confidence due to their clear contextual usage and semantic properties.
