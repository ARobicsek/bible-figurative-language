It is a standard narrative way of expressing the occurrence of events rather than attributing human-like action to inanimate "things" in a novel or striking metaphorical sense. It\'s akin to saying "trouble arose" or "joy came." Therefore, it is classified as standard narrative language or a common idiom for event occurrence, not a distinct figurative device like personification or a clear metaphor.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n2.  **Phrase:** הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה (the blessing and the curse)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if these abstract concepts are used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Blessing" and "curse" here refer directly to the literal positive and negative consequences of the covenant. They are not being compared to something else, nor are they personified. They are the actual outcomes being discussed.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **Phrase:** אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ (that I have set before you)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ" (natati lefaneykha, "I have given/set before your face") is a literal statement or a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While literally meaning "I have placed before your face," in the context of "the blessing and the curse," it does not imply a physical act of placing tangible objects in front of the people. Instead, it is a well-established biblical idiom signifying the presentation of choices, options, or consequences for consideration. God is presenting the covenant stipulations and their outcomes as a clear choice. This is a cross-domain comparison where a physical action (placing an object) represents an abstract act of presentation or offering a choice. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Decision:** Figurative, specifically an idiom.\n\n4.  **Phrase:** וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ (and you take them to heart / and you return to your heart)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ" (el-levavekha, "to your heart") and the action of "returning/taking to heart" is a literal physical action or a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and memory, not solely emotion. The phrase "to return to one\'s heart" or "to take to heart" is a classic idiom meaning to reflect deeply, consider, remember, or internalize something. It is not a literal physical action of moving something into the chest cavity. It represents a conceptual action of internalizing information or a situation, engaging one\'s thoughts and will. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where a physical location (the heart) and a physical action (returning/taking) represent a mental and volitional process. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Decision:** Figurative, specifically an idiom.\n\n5.  **Phrase:** בְּכׇ֨ל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (amidst the various nations to which your God יהוה has banished you)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "הִדִּיחֲךָ֛" (hidikhakha, "has banished you") is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This describes a direct, literal action of God causing the people to be exiled or dispersed among nations. There is no metaphorical or symbolic meaning beyond the literal act of banishment or dispersion.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies a spiritual and behavioral change rather than a physical journey. The guidelines instruct to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom." This phrase clearly fits that description.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom.\n\n2.  **"and you heed God’s command / listen to His voice" (וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "listening to His voice" implied a literal auditory perception of God\'s physical voice or a figurative expression of obedience.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase שָׁמַע בְּקוֹל (shama b\'qol), "to listen to the voice of," is a very common biblical idiom meaning to obey, heed, or comply with someone\'s instructions or commands. It does not suggest a literal hearing of a physical sound, but rather the act of submission to authority or instruction. This is a standard biblical idiom.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom.\n\n3.  **"just as I enjoin upon you this day" (כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this comparison ("just as I enjoin") was figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct and literal behavioral comparison, stating that the actions should align with the speaker\'s commands. The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons..." This phrase falls under that exclusion.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **"you and your children" (אַתָּ֣ה וּבָנֶ֔יךָ):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase was a synecdoche representing all future generations in a broader sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While it implies continuity, it literally refers to the immediate audience and their direct offspring. It is a literal statement identifying the recipients of the command.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"with all your heart and soul" (בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "heart" (לבב) and "soul" (נפש) were literal physical entities or figurative representations of one\'s inner being and totality.\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **"Heart" (לבב):** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" is primarily understood as the seat of intellect, will, and moral decision, not merely a physical organ or the seat of emotion as in modern English. To act "with all your heart" is an idiom for complete mental and volitional commitment. It functions as a metonymy where the organ (heart) represents the totality of one\'s inner intellectual and volitional self.\n        *   **"Soul" (נפש):** "Nefesh" refers to the entire living being, one\'s life force, desires, or self. To act "with all your soul" is an idiom for complete existential commitment, involving one\'s deepest desires and very life. It also functions as a metonymy where "soul" (life force/being) represents the entire person or their deepest essence.\n        *   **Combined phrase:** The pairing "heart and soul" is a classic biblical merism, a type of idiom that uses two complementary parts to express a totality. It signifies wholehearted, complete, and earnest devotion. Therefore, it is both an idiom and a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where parts represent the whole person).\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as an idiom and metonymy.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

1.  **Phrase: וְשָׁ֨ב יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ֖ (then your God יהוה will restore your fortunes / will restore your captivity)**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered whether the phrase הֵשִׁיב אֶת־שְׁבוּת (heshiv et-shevut) should be interpreted literally, as a metaphor, or as an idiom. A literal translation, such as "return the returning" or "return the captivity," does not fully capture the intended meaning and is grammatically unusual in its direct object construction.
    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This construction is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not refer to literally bringing back a physical "captivity" as an object, but rather to reversing the state of exile, misfortune, or captivity, thereby restoring the people's condition or "fortunes." The meaning is not directly derivable from the literal sum of its individual words, which is a defining characteristic of an idiom. The English translation's footnote offering "fortunes" as an alternative to "captivity" further highlights its idiomatic nature, as "captivity" itself is not an object to be literally returned but a state to be reversed. Therefore, it is classified as an idiom.
    *   **Borderline cases debated:** None. This is a standard idiomatic expression in Biblical Hebrew.

2.  **Phrase: וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ (and take you back in love / and have compassion on you)**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the verb רִחֲמֶ֑ךָ (from the root רחם, meaning "to have compassion, to show mercy") or its English translation "take you back in love" (as interpreted by the footnote) contained figurative language, particularly a metaphor related to a "householder."
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The Hebrew verb רחם directly describes God's emotional and volitional action of having compassion or mercy. While the English footnote provides a theological interpretation of the *implications* of God's compassion (likening it to a householder restoring standing), the Hebrew verb itself is a direct, literal description of God's attribute and action. It does not *itself* employ a metaphor. God is literally showing compassion. The "householder" image is an interpretive framework for understanding the *nature* of this compassion and restoration, not a direct linguistic figure embedded within this specific Hebrew clause.
    *   **Borderline cases debated:** The English footnote's elaboration on the "householder" image prompted careful consideration. However, the Hebrew verb itself functions as a literal description of divine action/emotion. The "householder" concept is a theological lens through which to understand God's actions, rather than a direct figurative expression in the text itself.

3.  **Phrase: וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים (and [God] will bring you together again from all the peoples)**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "bring you together again" (וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙, from קבץ) was figurative.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of the action of gathering scattered people. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or non-literal meaning involved.

4.  **Phrase: אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (where your God יהוה has scattered you)**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "has scattered you" (הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛, from פוץ) was figurative.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of the action of dispersing people. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or non-literal meaning involved.

I considered if "outcasts" (נִדַּחֲךָ֖) might be a metonymy for the people themselves, but it is a direct and literal description of their status (those who have been driven out or dispersed). Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" / "at the ends of the world (Lit. \'sky.\')"**: I considered whether this phrase should be taken literally or figuratively. Literally, it would imply a physical edge to the sky, which is not how the ancient Israelites understood the cosmos in a strictly geographical sense for human habitation. Instead, "the ends of the sky" (קְצֵה הַשָּׁמָיִם) is a common biblical expression used to denote the most extreme, remote, or inaccessible location imaginable. It functions as an exaggeration of distance and dispersion, emphasizing that no matter how far or scattered the people are, God\'s reach extends to them. This fits the definition of hyperbole, as it is an intentional overstatement for emphasis. It is not a literal description of a physical boundary of the sky, but rather a figurative way to express the utmost remoteness on earth.\n\n3.  **"מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" / "from there your God יהוה will gather you"**: I considered if "God will gather you" is a metaphor or an anthropomorphism. The guidelines state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Gathering" (קָבַץ) is an action, not a reference to a divine body part. In the ANE context, God\'s actions are often described in terms understandable to humans, but they are considered literal divine interventions. God literally brings the dispersed people together.

I have carefully analyzed each phrase in the provided Hebrew text for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the given guidelines.

1.  **וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ** (And your God יהוה will bring you to the land):
    *   **Considered:** Whether "bring you to the land" could be a metaphor for divine guidance or a symbolic journey.
    *   **Reasoning:** The verb הֵבִיא (hevi, Hifil of בוא) literally means "to bring" or "to cause to come." In this context, it describes a direct, literal action of God, either through physical movement or providential arrangement, to cause the people to enter and settle in the land. This is a standard narrative description of an event, not a cross-domain comparison or symbolic representation. Furthermore, divine anthropomorphisms (like God acting) are to be considered literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body, which is not the case here.
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

2.  **אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ** (that your fathers possessed):
    *   **Considered:** If "possessed" (יָרַשׁ - yarash) could be used in a non-literal sense, perhaps referring to a spiritual inheritance rather than physical ownership.
    *   **Reasoning:** The verb יָרַשׁ (yarash) means "to inherit, take possession of, dispossess." Here, it refers to the literal historical act of the ancestors taking physical possession of the land. This is a straightforward historical statement.
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

3.  **וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ** (and you shall possess it):
    *   **Considered:** Similar to the previous phrase, if this promise of future possession could be figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct, literal promise of future physical possession of the land by the current generation. It is a factual prediction of an event.
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

4.  **וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥** (and [God] will make you more prosperous / deal well with you):
    *   **Considered:** If "make you prosperous" (from הֵיטִיב - heitiv, Hifil of יטב, meaning "to do good, make good, deal well with") could be a metaphor for a state of being or a symbolic blessing.
    *   **Reasoning:** This describes a direct, literal action of God to improve the material and general well-being of the people. It is a promise of tangible prosperity, not a symbolic representation or a cross-domain comparison.
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

5.  **וְהִרְבְּךָ֖** (and [God] will make you more numerous):
    *   **Considered:** If "make you numerous" (from הִרְבָּה - hirbah, Hifil of רבה, meaning "to make many, multiply") could be a metaphor for influence or spiritual growth rather than literal population increase.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal promise of population growth and increase in number, a common blessing in the Old Testament. It refers to a quantifiable, factual outcome.
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

6.  **מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** (than your ancestors):
    *   **Considered:** This phrase involves a comparison. I considered if it falls under the category of "proportional or behavioral comparisons" which are explicitly stated *not* to be marked as figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "make you more prosperous and more numerous *than your ancestors*" is a direct, proportional comparison of quantity and quality between the future state of the people and their past ancestors. It directly aligns with the instruction: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'."
    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.

**Overall Conclusion:** Based on a thorough examination of each phrase and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no clear metaphors, similes, personifications, or biblical idioms (as defined by the examples given) are present in this verse. The text describes literal actions, promises, and historical facts.

A literal circumcision is a physical act performed on the foreskin. The heart is an internal organ, and in biblical Hebrew thought, also represents the inner being, will, and moral core.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: God cannot literally perform a physical circumcision on a human heart. This phrase involves a clear cross-domain comparison, where a physical ritual (circumcision) is applied to a non-physical, spiritual, or metaphorical entity (the heart as the seat of one\'s will and devotion). This constitutes a **metaphor**. Furthermore, "circumcision of the heart" is a well-established and recurring theological concept and phrase in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Deut 10:16, Jer 4:4), signifying a spiritual transformation, the removal of spiritual hardness or impurity, and the turning of one\'s will fully to God. As such, it functions as a **biblical idiom**. Within this idiom, the "heart" itself is used **metonymically** for the inner person, the will, or the moral core, rather than the physical organ. The English translation\'s footnote ("open up*open up Others “circumcise.”") also highlights the interpretive shift from the literal meaning of the Hebrew verb to its figurative application.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: None; this is a very clear instance of figurative language, encompassing both metaphor and idiom, with metonymy embedded in the use of "heart."\n\n2.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖" / "with all your heart and soul"**:\n    *   **What was considered**: I considered if this phrase, which describes the manner of loving God, is a literal enumeration of faculties or a figurative expression of totality. "Heart" (לֵבָב) and "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) refer to aspects of the inner person or life force.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: This is a highly common and formulaic expression in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Deut 6:5, 10:12, 11:13, 30:6). It signifies complete, total, and undivided devotion. While "heart" and "soul" have their own semantic ranges, their combination in this specific construction goes beyond a simple literal sum of parts. It functions as a set phrase, an **idiom**, to convey the abstract concept of wholehearted commitment. The "heart" here is used **metonymically** for the will, intellect, and emotions, and "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) is used **metonymically** for the entire self or life force. Together, they form an idiomatic expression for totality. The instruction to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type is directly applicable here.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: One could argue that "heart" and "soul" are simply being used in their broadest semantic range. However, the consistent pairing and the specific meaning of "total devotion" that emerges from this combination strongly indicate an idiomatic usage rather than a purely literal description.', 'fallback_used': False}

In English, "inflict curses" sounds like a direct action, but the Hebrew "natan" (give) can have a broader semantic range, including "bestow," "grant," or "cause to happen."\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. "God will give/inflict curses" describes a direct action of God, not referring to a body part. While curses are abstract concepts (negative consequences), God\'s "giving" them is a standard biblical expression for God\'s agency in bringing about these consequences. It is not a cross-domain comparison that would qualify as a clear metaphor (e.g., "God is a rock"). Nor is it an idiom in the sense of a fixed phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from its literal components (like "mouth of the sword"). It is a direct statement of divine action and consequence. Therefore, I classify this as standard narrative language describing divine action.\n\n2.  **"עַל־אֹיְבֶ֥יךָ וְעַל־שֹׂנְאֶ֖יךָ" (upon the enemies and foes):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the preposition "עַל" (upon) could imply a figurative sense of curses literally falling onto individuals.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a standard prepositional usage indicating the target or recipient of the action. The curses are directed *at* or *against* the enemies. There is no personification of curses falling, nor any metaphorical comparison involved. It is a literal description of the curses\' intended recipients.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר רְדָפֽוּךָ" (who persecuted you / who pursued you):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the verb "רדף" (to pursue, to persecute) might be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of the enemies\' actions. They actively pursued, harassed, and oppressed the Israelites. There is no figurative language present here.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, I find no clear metaphors, obvious similes, personification of non-human entities, or recognized biblical idioms in this verse.

While "return" can denote physical movement, in a spiritual or moral context, it often signifies a turning back to a previous state of obedience or a change of heart, i.e., repentance.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This usage of "שוב" (shuv) in relation to God or God\'s ways is a well-established biblical idiom for repentance or spiritual turning. It\'s not a literal physical return to a geographical location, but a metaphorical "return" to a relationship or a way of life. The instructions explicitly state to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type.

"Voice" is an attribute associated with speaking and communication, not a physical body part like a "finger" that would necessitate a figurative interpretation. In the ANE context, God\'s voice is understood as a direct means of divine communication, whether audible or through revelation. Therefore, "hearing the voice of YHWH" is treated as a literal description of receiving divine communication.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** None, given the explicit instruction regarding anthropomorphisms.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְעָשִׂ֙יתָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֔יו** (and obey all His commandments)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "obey all His commandments" contains any figurative language.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a straightforward, literal command to follow divine laws.

It employs metonymy (specifically synecdoche), where the "hand" (a part) represents the entire person\'s labor, efforts, or undertakings (the whole or the agent of the action). It refers to the full scope of one\'s endeavors, not just the literal output of the physical hand.

"in the fruit of your womb")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "fruit of your womb" is a literal description of human offspring or a metaphorical expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The term "fruit" (פְּרִי) primarily refers to the produce of plants. Its application to human offspring ("womb") constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison. The reproductive outcome of plants (the vehicle) is used to describe the reproductive outcome of humans (the tenor). This is a classic metaphor. Furthermore, it is a very common and established biblical idiom for children or progeny.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as figurative (metaphor, idiom).\n\n3.  **"וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛" (uvifri vehemtkha) - "the offspring of your cattle" (lit. "and in the fruit of your cattle")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "fruit of your cattle" is a literal description of animal offspring or a metaphorical expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to "fruit of the womb," the term "fruit" (פְּרִי) is here extended from its primary domain (plants) to describe the offspring of animals. This is a clear cross-domain comparison, using the reproductive outcome of plants (the vehicle) to describe the reproductive outcome of animals (the tenor). This is a clear metaphor.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as figurative (metaphor).\n\n4.  **"וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖" (uvifri admatkha) - "and your produce from the soil" (lit. "and in the fruit of your ground")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "fruit of your ground" is a literal description or figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "fruit" (פְּרִי) refers to the literal produce of the soil, which is its primary and literal meaning. There is no cross-domain comparison or idiomatic usage here.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"כִּ֣י׀ יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב" (ki yashuv YHWH lasus alekha letov) - "For יהוה will again delight in your well-being" (lit. "For YHWH will return to rejoice over you for good")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered two potential figurative elements here:\n        *   `יָשׁוּב` (yashuv) - "will return": I considered if this implies a literal physical movement of God.\n        *   `לָשׂוּשׂ עָלֶיךָ` (lasus alekha) - "to rejoice over you" / "to delight in you": I considered if attributing an emotion like rejoicing to God is figurative (personification).\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   In this context, `יָשׁוּב` (will return) functions idiomatically to mean "again" or "restore a previous state/action," indicating a resumption of God\'s favorable disposition rather than a physical return. This is a common usage for divine action and is not considered figurative in the sense of a metaphor for movement.\n        *   Attributing emotions such as "rejoicing" or "delight" to God falls under "Divine anthropomorphisms." The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Rejoicing is an emotion, not a physical body part. Therefore, according to the provided guidelines, this is to be considered literal.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n6.  **"כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ" (ka\'asher sas al avotekha) - "as in that of your ancestors" (lit. "as He rejoiced over your ancestors")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this comparison ("as He rejoiced over your ancestors") constitutes a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: ... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a behavioral comparison of God\'s past actions (rejoicing over ancestors) with His future actions (rejoicing over the current generation). Therefore, it should not be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, stating that it is "not far away" cannot be interpreted literally in terms of physical proximity. Instead, it employs a spatial metaphor, using the concept of physical distance (far/close) to describe the conceptual and practical accessibility and attainability of the instruction.

The phrase "not far away" to mean "accessible" or "attainable" is a very common idiomatic expression in Hebrew (and many other languages), even though its root is metaphorical. Given the instruction to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type, and that this phrase functions idiomatically to convey accessibility, it is appropriate to mark it as both a metaphor (due to the underlying conceptual mapping) and an idiom (due to its conventionalized usage).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is figurative language, specifically a metaphor and an idiom.', 'fallback_used': False}

The preceding verses (Deut 30:11) establish that the commandment is "not too difficult for you, nor is it far off." The statement "It is not in the heavens" is a literal denial of its physical placement in the celestial realm, which would indeed make it unattainable. It sets up the rhetorical question that follows, but the statement itself is a direct, literal assertion about the commandment\'s non-location.

Instead, the question serves to emphasize the extreme difficulty or impossibility of such an endeavor, thereby highlighting the *accessibility* of the commandment (which is "not in the heavens"). This exaggeration of an impossible task to make a point about the commandment\'s actual proximity and ease of observance is a clear instance of hyperbole.

However, in this context (Deuteronomy 30:13), the phrase is presented as a literal geographical location, contrasting it with the word\'s actual proximity. The rhetorical argument uses literal, albeit distant, locations (heaven and beyond the sea) to emphasize that the commandment is not hidden or far away. The difficulty of reaching such a place is inherent in the literal description, not a figurative meaning of the phrase itself. It serves as a literal extreme point in a rhetorical argument about accessibility. Therefore, I exclude it as figurative.\n\n2.  **מִ֣י יַעֲבׇר־לָ֜נוּ אֶל־עֵ֤בֶר הַיָּם֙ / Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea:** Similar to the above, I considered if this action was a metaphor for an impossible task. However, it describes a literal, albeit challenging, physical journey. The rhetorical question highlights the practical impossibility *of that specific literal journey* for the purpose of retrieving the word. It is not a cross-domain comparison but a statement about the feasibility of a literal action. Therefore, I exclude it as figurative.\n\n3.  **וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ / and get it for us:** I considered if "get it" (לָקַח) in reference to the "word" (which is abstract) could be a metaphor for understanding or receiving divine revelation. However, within the hypothetical scenario of someone traveling to a distant place, "getting" or "taking" something is presented as a literal action of acquisition. The abstract nature of the "word" does not automatically render the act of "getting" it figurative in this context, especially when paired with a literal journey. Therefore, I exclude it as figurative.\n\n4.  **וְיַשְׁמִעֵ֥נוּ אֹתָ֖הּ / and impart it to us (lit. and make us hear it):** I considered if "make us hear it" (הִשְׁמִיעַ) could be a metonymy for teaching or understanding, or if "hearing" itself was a metonymy for obedience. While "hearing" (שמע) often implies obedience in biblical Hebrew, the causative form הִשְׁמִיעַ (to cause to hear, to announce, to proclaim) here refers to the act of verbal communication. The person who retrieves the word would literally speak it so the people could hear it. The subsequent action of "doing" (וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה) is where the obedience comes in. Thus, the act of "making hear" is literal communication. Therefore, I exclude it as figurative.\n\n5.  **וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה / that we may observe it (lit. and we will do it):** I considered if "do it" (עָשָׂה) in relation to the "word" or commandment was a literal physical action or an idiom for obedience. In biblical Hebrew, the phrase "to do the commandments" (לַעֲשׂוֹת אֶת־הַמִּצְוֹת) or simply "to do it" (referring to the law) is a well-established idiom meaning to obey, fulfill, and live according to the divine instructions. It encompasses more than just a physical act; it represents the full adherence to the covenant. This is a clear case of an idiom where a specific action (doing) stands for a broader concept (observing/obeying the law). Therefore, I include it as an idiom.', 'fallback_used': False}

It\'s a common, almost literal, way to describe the proximity of an abstract concept to one\'s grasp or comprehension. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative language.\n\n2.  **בְּפִ֥יךָ וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖** (in your mouth and in your heart)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase is literal or figurative. Specifically, I examined if "mouth" and "heart" are used metonymically and if the combined phrase functions as an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is clearly figurative.\n        *   **"in your mouth" (בְּפִ֥יךָ):** The mouth is a physical body part, but here it metonymically represents speech, declaration, confession, or the ability to articulate the commandment. The commandment is not literally *inside* the mouth in a physical sense, but rather expressed *through* it. This is a metonymy where a part (mouth) stands for its function (speech/declaration).\n        *   **"in your heart" (וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖):** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral decision-making, not merely a physical organ. Therefore, "in your heart" metonymically refers to the internal understanding, acceptance, and commitment to the commandment within one\'s inner being, mind, and will. This is a metonymy where the physical organ stands for its associated mental and spiritual faculties.\n        *   **As an Idiom:** The combined phrase "in your mouth and in your heart" functions as a well-established biblical idiom. It signifies the complete internalization, comprehension, and readiness to both declare and act upon the divine commandment. The guidelines explicitly state that "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase perfectly fits that description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This phrase is figurative, functioning as both metonymy (for "mouth" and "heart" individually) and as a collective idiom.\n\n3.  **לַעֲשֹׂתֽו** (to observe it / to do it)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "to observe/do" might be used in a figurative sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal instruction to perform or fulfill the commandment. It is standard narrative language describing an action. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative language.', 'fallback_used': False}

While it implies mental attention and understanding, its primary function here is a direct command to observe or take note. It does not involve a clear cross-domain comparison or a substitution of a physical action for a purely abstract concept in a way that would qualify as figurative language (e.g., metonymy) under the given conservative guidelines. It is standard narrative language for drawing attention to what follows.\n\n2.  **נָתַ֤תִּי לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ (natati l\'faneykha) - "I set before you"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the phrase "לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" (literally "before your face") in conjunction with "נָתַ֤תִּי" (I have given/set) was a literal description of physical placement or a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: This is a clear biblical idiom. While "לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" literally means "before your face," in this context, it does not refer to a physical object being placed directly in front of someone\'s facial features. Instead, it functions as a conventionalized expression meaning "I present to you," "I offer you," or "I place at your disposal." This idiom is used to emphasize the direct presentation of choices or options to an individual or group, making them aware and responsible for their decision. This falls under the guideline to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: One might argue it\'s a mild metaphor (treating choices as physical objects placed), but its frequent and conventionalized use in this sense across the Hebrew Bible firmly establishes it as an idiom. The instruction explicitly states to classify figurative idioms as "idiom."\n\n3.  **הַיּ֔וֹם (hayyom) - "this day"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "this day" could be used figuratively, perhaps as a metonymy for a significant era or a specific moment of decision.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: "This day" is a literal temporal reference, emphasizing the immediacy and present reality of the choice being offered. It is not used in a way that suggests a figurative meaning beyond its direct temporal denotation.\n\n4.  **אֶת־הַֽחַיִּ֖ים וְאֶת־הַטּ֑וֹב (et-ha-chayyim v\'et-ha-tov) - "life and prosperity"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "life" and "prosperity" were used literally or as metonymy for the *consequences* of choosing good.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: "Life" (חַיִּים) here refers to a state of well-being, flourishing, and vitality, which is its primary and literal meaning in this context. "Prosperity" (טוֹב) refers to good fortune, positive outcomes, and general well-being. These are presented as the direct and literal results or states associated with a particular choice. They are not standing in for something else in a figurative way; they *are* the things being offered as outcomes.\n\n5.  **וְאֶת־הַמָּ֖וֶת וְאֶת־הָרָֽע (v\'et-ha-mavet v\'et-ha-ra\') - "death and adversity"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "death" and "adversity" were used literally or as metonymy for the *consequences* of choosing evil.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: Similar to "life and prosperity," "death" (מָוֶת) here refers to a state of non-being, destruction, or severe suffering, which is its primary and literal meaning. "Adversity" (רָע) refers to evil, harm, or negative outcomes. These are presented as the direct and literal results or states associated with the opposite choice.

While these are abstract concepts, the command itself is literal and refers to a genuine, albeit multifaceted, human response to God. It is not a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal expression of emotion in the sense of figurative language. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **"to walk in God’s ways" (לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו)**:\n    *   Considered: This phrase was immediately identified as a strong candidate for figurative language. "Walking" (הָלַךְ) typically refers to physical locomotion, and "ways" (דֶּרֶךְ) to a physical path.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a clear metaphor and a very common biblical idiom. The physical act of "walking" is used to represent one\'s conduct, lifestyle, or adherence to a set of principles. "God\'s ways" refers not to literal paths God physically traverses, but to God\'s character, commands, and moral standards. The comparison is between a physical journey and a moral/spiritual journey, making it a clear cross-domain comparison. It is also a well-established biblical idiom for living righteously according to God\'s will. Therefore, it is marked as figurative (metaphor and idiom).\n\n4.  **"and to keep God’s commandments, God’s laws, and God’s rules" (וְלִשְׁמֹ֛ר מִצְוֺתָ֥יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֖יו וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֑יו)**:\n    *   Considered: If "keep" (שָׁמַר) or the categories of divine instruction (commandments, laws, rules) could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: "To keep" in this context means to observe, obey, or guard, which are literal actions in relation to the divine precepts. The commandments, laws, and rules themselves are literal categories of divine instruction.

They are not exaggerated beyond reasonable expectation in the ANE context, nor do they represent a non-literal domain. Therefore, they are not marked as figurative.\n\n6.  **"and that your God יהוה may bless you" (וּבֵֽרַכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ)**:\n    *   Considered: If "bless" (בָּרַךְ) is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a direct statement of divine action, conferring literal favor, prosperity, and well-being.

I also considered if the entire phrase functions as a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לב/לבב) is consistently used as a metonymy for the inner person, the seat of intellect, will, and moral decision-making, rather than just the physical organ. Therefore, "your heart" represents your inner being or will. The verb "יִפְנֶ֥ה" (turns away), which literally means to turn or face, is applied metaphorically to this inner will, signifying a change in direction, allegiance, or disposition away from God. The combination of "heart" as metonymy and "turns away" as metaphor forms a well-established biblical expression for spiritual defection or apostasy, functioning as an idiom. This clearly fits the criteria for metaphor, metonymy, and idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None; this is a clear example of multiple types of figurative language.\n\n2.  **"וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע" (and you give no heed / do not listen):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "תִשְׁמָ֑ע" (listen/heed) in the negative sense ("not listen") constitutes an idiom for "not obey."\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** While "to listen" (שמע) in biblical Hebrew often carries the implication of "to obey," this is more of a semantic extension or a direct consequence of listening, rather than a distinct figurative idiom in the same vein as "heart turns away." It is a literal statement of failing to pay attention or heed instructions. The instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and to classify only clear figurative idioms leads me to exclude this as a figurative element.\n\n3.  **"וְנִדַּחְתָּ֗" (and are lured / driven away / led astray):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the verb "נדח" (nadach), meaning to be driven away, banished, or led astray, implies a figurative "luring."\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The Hebrew verb describes a literal state or action of being moved from a proper path or place. While the English translation "lured" might suggest a figurative sense, the underlying Hebrew is a direct description of being influenced to depart from the right path or being pushed off course. It is not a metaphor, simile, or personification.\n\n4.  **"וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֛יתָ לֵאלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים וַעֲבַדְתָּֽם" (and you worship and serve other gods):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "worship" (השתחוית) or "serve" (עבדתם) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** These are literal actions of bowing down and performing service, even if the objects of worship/service are considered false from the text\'s theological perspective.

It serves as a temporal marker for the speech event and carries no hidden or non-literal meaning. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"כִּ֥י אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵד֑וּן" (that you shall certainly perish)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "perish" (אָבֹד תֹּאבֵדוּן, an infinitive absolute for emphasis) could be a metaphor for something other than literal destruction or demise.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The verb אָבַד (avad) means to be lost, destroyed, or to die. In this context, it refers to the literal national and physical destruction or disappearance of the people.

I considered if this was a literal command to physically extend the duration of individual days or if it had a different meaning.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a very common and well-established biblical idiom. "To lengthen days" (הֶאֱרִיךְ יָמִים) consistently means "to live a long life" or, in the collective sense, "to endure for a long time" as a nation. It is not about literally making days longer, but about the duration of existence. This constitutes both an idiom and a form of metonymy, where "days" (a unit of time) stands for "life" or "duration of existence." The instructions explicitly state to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, and metonymy is a valid figurative type.

The statement is about their physical presence and duration *on* that specific geographical entity. It is used literally.

While these are not sentient beings in a human sense, the act of "witnessing" (הַעִדֹ֨תִי) is a distinctly human legal function. Attributing this capacity to non-human entities like the sky and the ground, implying they observe and remember the covenant, is a clear instance of personification. It\'s not simply a metonymy for "everything" but specifically for entities that can "testify" or "bear witness" to an event. Therefore, it is marked as personification.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** One might argue it\'s a conventional idiom, but the underlying mechanism of that idiom is the attribution of human qualities to non-human entities, which is personification. The instruction explicitly states to "Mark as figurative: Personification of non-human entities."\n\n2.  **"הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה" / "I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse."**\n    *   **Considered:** If "life and death, blessing and curse" being "put before" someone is a literal action or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Life and death" and "blessing and curse" are abstract concepts, not physical objects that can be literally placed in front of a person. The phrase "נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ" (I have put before you) is a common biblical idiom signifying the presentation of choices, options, or paths with their associated consequences. It treats these abstract concepts as if they were concrete items laid out for selection. As per instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This fits the definition of a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** This could be seen as a mild form of reification (treating an abstract concept as concrete), which is a type of metaphor. However, given its conventional usage as a set phrase for presenting choices, "idiom" is the most appropriate classification according to the provided guidelines.\n\n3.  **"וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ" / "Choose life—if you and your offspring would live—"**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "choose life" or "would live" contains any figurative language.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Choose life" is a direct command to select the path that leads to actual, literal existence and well-being. "Live" (תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה) refers to the literal state of being alive and thriving. These are straightforward, literal statements about making a choice and its direct, literal consequence.

2025-09-21 13:50:03,918 - ERROR - Invalid JSON response: DELIBERATION:

I have analyzed every phrase in the provided Hebrew text and its English translation for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the given guidelines.

1.  **לְאַֽהֲבָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ** (by loving your God יהוה):
    *   **Considered:** Whether "loving God" could be interpreted as a metaphor or other figurative expression.
    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase describes a fundamental religious and covenantal attitude and action. While "love" can be expressed metaphorically in other contexts, here it refers to a genuine emotional, volitional, and behavioral commitment to God. It is a direct command for devotion and loyalty, not a cross-domain comparison.
    *   **Decision:** Literal.

2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice):
    *   **Considered:** If "listening to His voice" (שמע בקול) is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "שמע בקול X" (to listen to the voice of X) is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew meaning "to obey X" or "to heed X's commands/instructions." While "voice" is a physical attribute, in this idiomatic usage, it functions as a metonymy where the means of communication ("voice") stands for the content of the communication ("commands" or "instructions"), and the act of "listening" stands for "obeying." The instruction explicitly states, "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as 'idiom' type." This phrase perfectly fits that description.
    *   **Borderline:** One might initially consider it a literal anthropomorphism (God having a voice), but the idiomatic meaning of obedience overrides a purely literal interpretation of hearing a sound. The English translation "heeding God's commands" correctly captures the idiomatic sense.
    *   **Decision:** Figurative – Idiom (specifically, metonymy).

3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God] / clinging to Him):
    *   **Considered:** Whether "clinging" or "holding fast" to God is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The verb דבק (dabaq) literally means to stick, cleave, or cling physically. When applied to God, it is a clear metaphor. God is not a physical entity one can literally cling to. Instead, the physical act of clinging is used to represent a deep, unwavering spiritual, emotional, and covenantal loyalty, devotion, and commitment. It is a cross-domain comparison where a physical action describes an abstract relational state.
    *   **Decision:** Figurative – Metaphor.

4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For thereby you shall have life / For He is your life):
    *   **Considered:** If "He is your life" is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct equation of God with "life." God is not literally the abstract concept of "life" itself, nor is He a biological life force in a physical sense. This statement is a powerful metaphor asserting that God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of true, meaningful, and abundant life for the people, encompassing both physical existence and spiritual/covenantal well-being. It is a clear cross-domain comparison.
    *   **Decision:** Figurative – Metaphor.

5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and shall long endure / and the length of your days):
    *   **Considered:** If "length of your days" is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase literally refers to longevity or a long lifespan. While "length" is a spatial term applied to time, this is a conventional and literal way to express duration in Hebrew and many other languages. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison in a figurative sense.
    *   **Decision:** Literal.

6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (upon the soil / to dwell upon the land):
    *   **Considered:** If "to dwell upon the land/soil" is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal description of residing in a physical territory. "Land" (אדמה) refers to the physical ground.
    *   **Decision:** Literal.

7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם** (that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them):
    *   **Considered:** If "יהוה swore" (נשבע יהוה) is figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a divine anthropomorphism. The instructions state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." "Swearing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. In the ANE worldview, deities were often described as performing human-like actions. Therefore, according to the guidelines, this is considered literal.
    *   **Decision:** Literal.
