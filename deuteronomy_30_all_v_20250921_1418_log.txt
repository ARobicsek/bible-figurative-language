It does not present a striking cross-domain comparison or attribute a distinctly human characteristic to an inanimate object in a way that would be considered figurative in a standard narrative context. It\'s a standard idiomatic expression for "happening to" or "affecting." Therefore, it is treated as standard narrative language rather than a clear instance of personification.\n\n2.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ" (that I have set before you)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this phrase, literally "that I have given before your face/presence," is a metaphor for presenting choices or consequences, or a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion (as idiom):** This is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not imply a literal physical placement of objects in front of someone\'s face. Instead, it signifies the act of presenting options, choices, or consequences for consideration, decision, or experience. The "face" (פָּנִים) here represents presence or attention, and "giving/setting before" means to make something known or available for interaction. It\'s a fixed expression with a meaning beyond the sum of its literal parts.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None, this is a clear idiom.\n\n3.  **"וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ" (and you take them to heart / return to your heart)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this phrase, literally "and you will return to your heart," is a metaphor for deep reflection or internalization, or a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion (as idiom):** This is a classic biblical idiom. The "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) in biblical Hebrew is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, not merely a physical organ. To "return to one\'s heart" means to reflect deeply, to consider carefully, to internalize, or to repent. It\'s a figurative use of "heart" combined with the action of "returning" to convey an internal mental and emotional process. It\'s a fixed expression.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None, this is a clear idiom.\n\n4.  **"אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה" (to which your God יהוה has banished you there)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ" (YHWH your God has banished you) constitutes a divine anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The act of "banishing" is a direct action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific physical body part of God. Therefore, according to the provided guidelines, this is to be understood as a literal divine action within the ANE context and not marked as figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies a spiritual and moral turning, not a physical relocation. This is a standard expression for repentance and covenant fidelity.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as an idiom.\n\n2.  **"וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ" (and you heed God’s command / listen to His voice)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "listening to His voice" refers strictly to auditory perception or if it carries a deeper meaning of obedience.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "שמע בקול" (to listen to the voice of) is a common biblical idiom that means "to obey," "to heed," or "to comply with the command of." While God does speak, the emphasis here is on the human response of obedience to divine instruction, rather than merely the act of hearing. It\'s a conventional way to express submission to authority.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as an idiom.\n\n3.  **"כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם" (just as I enjoin upon you this day)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the comparative particle "כְּ" (like/as) makes this a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase falls under this category. It is a literal statement indicating that their obedience should be in exact accordance with the commands given by Moses on that day. It describes the manner and extent of their obedience, not a figurative comparison.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **"אַתָּ֣ה וּבָנֶ֔יךָ" (you and your children)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "children" might be a synecdoche for all future generations or descendants in a broader sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "children" (בנים) often has implications for future generations in covenantal contexts, in this direct address, it primarily refers to the immediate family and their direct offspring who are part of the covenant community. It is a literal reference to the family unit and its continuity, rather than a figurative representation of a larger, more abstract concept.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ" (with all your heart and soul)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase is a merism (a type of synecdoche) or a general idiom for complete devotion.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך" (with all your heart and with all your soul) is a classic biblical idiom expressing total, complete, and undivided commitment, devotion, and inner being. "Heart" (לבב) in Hebrew thought represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, while "soul" (נפש) refers to the life force, the inner self, or the entire person. Together, they form a merism that signifies the entirety of one\'s being and dedication. As per the instructions, figurative idioms should be classified as "idiom." This phrase is a well-established idiom for absolute devotion.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as an idiom.', 'fallback_used': False}

While a literal translation might be "to return the return" or "to bring back the captivity," its established meaning in context is "to restore fortunes" or "to bring back from exile/captivity." It functions as a fixed expression whose meaning is not simply the sum of its literal parts. The English note\'s alternative "captivity" further highlights the idiomatic nature, as "restore your captivity" doesn\'t make sense literally in English, but "restore your fortunes" captures the idiomatic meaning. This fits the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. It is not a clear cross-domain metaphor, nor is it primarily metonymy, but rather a set phrase with a specialized meaning.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None, this is a clear idiom.\n\n2.  **Phrase/Concept:** וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ (and take you back in love / and have compassion on you)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if God\'s act of "having compassion" or "taking back in love" could be an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative, or if the accompanying English note about the "householder image" implied a metaphor or simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb רחם (racham) means "to have compassion, show mercy, love." God exhibiting emotions like compassion is a divine anthropomorphism. The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "having compassion" does not refer to a physical body part of God, it is treated as a literal action/emotion of God in this context. The English note explaining the "householder image" provides cultural context and interpretive nuance for understanding the *implications* of God\'s compassion, but it does not indicate that the Hebrew verb רחם itself is a metaphor or simile. The text does not explicitly state "God is like a householder" or "God is a householder." Therefore, this phrase is not marked as figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The interpretive note about the "householder image" made me pause, but the instructions are clear about treating anthropomorphisms as literal unless they refer to God\'s body, and the note is an explanation of cultural context rather than an identification of a direct figurative device in the Hebrew.\n\n3.  **Phrase/Concept:** וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים (and [God] will bring you together again from all the peoples)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if God "gathering" the people could be a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb קבץ (kabatz) means "to gather, collect." This is a literal action of bringing dispersed people together. It is a direct description of God\'s action in reversing the exile. It is not a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, this is not marked as figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None.\n\n4.  **Phrase/Concept:** אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (where your God יהוה has scattered you)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if God "scattering" the people could be a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb פוץ (putz) means "to scatter, disperse." This is a literal action of dispersing people, commonly used to describe exile or forced migration. While one might scatter seeds, "scattering people" is a direct and literal description of their dispersion. It is not a clear cross-domain comparison that would qualify as a metaphor. Therefore, this is not marked as figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None.', 'fallback_used': False}

It is not standing in for something else in a figurative way, but rather precisely identifying the group being discussed. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n2.  **בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם (biqṣê haššāmāyim) - "at the ends of the heavens/sky"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if this phrase refers to a literal geographical location, or if it functions as a metaphor, idiom, or hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning for including**:\n        *   **Not a literal location**: There are no literal "ends" to the physical sky that one can reach on Earth. The phrase does not denote a specific, tangible geographical point.\n        *   **Idiom**: This phrase functions as a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew to convey the furthest possible reaches of the earth or the known world. Its meaning ("the most distant place") cannot be derived simply from the literal meaning of "ends" and "sky." It is a set phrase used to express extreme distance. This aligns with the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type.\n        *   **Hyperbole**: Beyond being an idiom, the phrase also employs hyperbole. It exaggerates the distance to an impossible extreme ("ends of the sky") in order to emphasize the vastness and thoroughness of the dispersion of the Israelites. This overstatement highlights that no matter how far they are scattered, God will still gather them.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated**: The primary debate was whether to classify it solely as an idiom or also as hyperbole. Given that many idioms inherently contain an element of exaggeration, and the "ends of the sky" clearly overstates the physical distance to make a point, classifying it as both idiom and hyperbole accurately captures its figurative force.\n\n3.  **יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ (yəqabbəṣəḵā YHWH ʾĕlōheḵā) - "your God YHWH will gather you"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "gather" here is a metaphor for spiritual restoration or a literal physical gathering of people.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding**: In the context of exile and return, "gathering" is a literal and direct action of bringing dispersed people back together to their land. It is a standard narrative action attributed to God concerning the restoration of Israel. This is not a figurative comparison but a description of a concrete divine act. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n4.  **וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ (ūmiššām yiqqāḥeḵā) - "and from there [God] will fetch you / take you"**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "fetch/take" is a metaphor for a deeper, non-physical action.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding**: Similar to "gather," this is a literal action of God bringing the people back from their places of dispersion. It describes a direct, concrete divine intervention. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

The comparison "more numerous than your ancestors" provides a specific benchmark, indicating a literal increase beyond previous generations. The instructions advise conservatism with standard narrative language and character actions, and this is a standard divine promise of demographic expansion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ / than your ancestors"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if this comparative phrase could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a direct proportional comparison ("more prosperous and more numerous *than* your ancestors"). Therefore, it must be treated as a literal comparison.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not figurative.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of each phrase against the provided guidelines, no elements in this verse meet the criteria for figurative language. The text employs standard narrative language to describe literal divine actions, promises, and comparisons.', 'fallback_used': False}

The English translation "open up" already interprets this figuratively, while the footnote "Others \'circumcise.\'" points to the literal Hebrew meaning of the verb.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Physically circumcising a human heart is anatomically impossible and not the practice of circumcision. The act of circumcision is a physical removal of foreskin. Applying this physical act to the "heart," which in biblical thought represents the inner self, will, and emotions, constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison. This is a **metaphor**. The physical act (vehicle) signifies a spiritual transformation or removal of spiritual impurity/resistance (tenor). Furthermore, "circumcise the heart" is a well-established and recurring phrase in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Deut 10:16, Jer 4:4), functioning as a **biblical idiom** for spiritual renewal and obedience.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None.

When it is the object of "circumcision" or the seat of "love," it clearly refers to this broader internal essence. The physical organ stands for its associated functions and the core of one\'s being. The same reasoning applies to "the hearts of your offspring."\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a standard understanding of "heart" in biblical Hebrew.\n\n3.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ / with all your heart and soul"**:\n    *   **Considered:** I considered this phrase as a whole and its individual components.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is a classic **biblical idiom** expressing complete and total devotion. It combines "heart" (לֵבָב) and "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ). As discussed, "heart" is **metonymic** for the inner self, will, and intellect. "Soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) is also **metonymic**, representing the life-force, the entire being, or one\'s very existence. The combination of these two significant internal aspects creates a comprehensive expression of totality. While the individual components are metonymic, the phrase as a whole functions as a set expression for absolute commitment.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a fundamental expression of devotion in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n4.  **"לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ / in order that you may live"**:\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "live" (חַיֶּֽיךָ) might imply a figurative sense of spiritual life or eternal life beyond mere physical existence.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "life" in a covenantal context often carries deep theological implications of well-being, prosperity, and a flourishing relationship with God, the term "live" itself is a standard, literal concept. The instructions specify being conservative with standard narrative language and not marking proportional or behavioral comparisons as figurative. While the *quality* of life might be enhanced, the act of living is literal. It is the literal outcome of the spiritual transformation, not a figurative expression in itself.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This could be seen as having deeper, non-literal *implications*, but the word "live" itself is not a metaphor, simile, or personification. Therefore, it is excluded based on the conservative guidelines.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

While "return" can denote physical movement, in a covenantal context, "returning to YHWH" often implies a change in behavior and a renewed commitment to the divine path.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The instructions emphasize being "conservative with standard narrative language" and not marking "proportional or behavioral comparisons" as figurative. While "returning" in a spiritual sense is not a physical act, it is a very common and almost lexicalized theological concept in biblical Hebrew (e.g., "return to YHWH" as a call to repentance). It describes a change in spiritual and behavioral orientation directly, rather than through a novel cross-domain comparison. Therefore, I classify this as a literal description of a change in conduct and spiritual alignment, not a clear metaphor.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will hear/heed the voice of יהוה):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" (the voice of YHWH) constitutes personification (attributing a physical voice to God) or metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom.

"ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" functions as an idiom, similar to "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of YHWH), referring not to a literal, audible physical voice but to God\'s commands, instructions, or pronouncements.

No figurative language is present.\n\n**Borderline cases:** The phrase "תָשׁוּב" (you will return/turn back) was the only borderline case.

It implies a responsive action to divine communication. This is also a form of metonymy where "voice" (the means of communication) stands for "command/word/will" (the content to be obeyed).

The phrase "with all your heart and soul" is a well-established biblical idiom (and a merism, a type of metonymy/synecdoche) expressing totality, wholeheartedness, and complete devotion of one\'s entire inner being. It is not a literal reference to physical body parts.

The English translation "baffling" might suggest a mental state that could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** In this context, "נִפְלֵאת" describes an inherent quality of the instruction – its level of difficulty or extraordinariness – in relation to human capacity. It directly states that the instruction *is not* difficult or extraordinary *for them* to understand or perform. This is a direct assessment of the instruction\'s nature and its accessibility to the people, rather than a cross-domain comparison (e.g., it\'s not saying "the instruction is a riddle that baffles you"). It\'s a literal statement about the instruction\'s comprehensibility and feasibility.\n\n3.  **"וְלֹ֥א רְחֹקָ֖ה הִֽוא" (nor is it beyond reach / nor is it far):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered whether "רְחֹקָה" (far, distant) when applied to an abstract concept like an "instruction" is a metaphor for inaccessibility or unattainability.\n    *   **Reasoning for including:** An instruction is an abstract concept and cannot be physically "far" or "near" in a literal spatial sense. The use of "רְחֹקָה" (distant) here is a clear cross-domain comparison. Physical distance (the vehicle) is used to describe the spiritual, moral, or practical accessibility and attainability (the tenor) of the instruction. If something is "far," it implies it is hard to reach or acquire. Therefore, "not far" means it is accessible, attainable, and within reach. This fits the definition of a clear metaphor. This is further supported by the subsequent verses in Deuteronomy 30, which explicitly state the instruction is "not in heaven" and "not beyond the sea," reinforcing the metaphorical use of distance for accessibility.', 'fallback_used': False}

In this context, the statement "It is not in the heavens" is a literal denial of the physical location of "it" (referring to the commandment/Torah, as per the broader context of Deuteronomy 30). The intent is to convey that the commandment is not physically distant or inaccessible, as if it were located in the literal heavens. The comparison is to a literal, albeit extremely high and distant, physical location.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n2.  **"מִ֣י יַעֲלֶה־לָּ֤נוּ הַשָּׁמַ֙יְמָה֙ / Who among us can go up to the heavens"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if the act of "going up to the heavens" might be a hyperbole or a metaphor for an impossible task.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While the rhetorical question emphasizes the extreme difficulty or impossibility of such a journey for a human, the language itself describes a literal physical action of ascending to a literal location (the heavens). The impossibility is a literal consequence of human limitations and the vastness of the heavens, not a figurative description of the action itself. It is a literal statement about an unachievable physical feat.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ / and get it for us"**:\n    *   **Considered**: This phrase describes a straightforward action of retrieval.\n    *   **Reasoning**: There is no indication of metaphorical or other figurative usage.

However, given the conservative guidelines, which emphasize treating standard narrative language and literal interpretations of physical locations as such, and only marking "clear metaphors," "personification," or "obvious similes," this passage does not meet the criteria for figurative language. The "heavens" are presented as a literal, albeit distant and inaccessible, location, and the actions described are literal actions one would take in relation to such a location. The passage\'s purpose is to literally state the accessibility of the commandment, contrasting it with a literally impossible physical journey.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there is no figurative language in this verse according to the provided instructions.', 'fallback_used': False}

In some contexts, such phrases can denote an impossible or exceedingly challenging task.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verse explicitly frames this as a literal geographical location that would require a physical journey: "Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us...". The rhetorical question highlights the physical challenge of such a journey, not an abstract or metaphorical one. The point of the passage (Deuteronomy 30:11-14) is that the commandment is *not* physically distant or hidden in such places, but rather "very near you." Therefore, the sea and the act of crossing it are presented literally as a measure of physical distance and effort, not as a cross-domain comparison or exaggeration for an abstract concept.\n\n2.  **"get it for us" (וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ)**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "it" (referring to the commandment from the preceding context) being "gotten" or "taken" might be personification or metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The act of "taking" or "getting" (לָקַח) in relation to an abstract concept like a commandment is a standard, literal way of describing the acquisition of knowledge, understanding, or possession of its content. It does not imbue the commandment with human qualities (personification) nor does it substitute a related concept (metonymy). It\'s a direct description of obtaining the information.\n\n3.  **"impart it to us" (וְיַשְׁמִעֵ֥נוּ אֹתָ֖הּ)**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "impart it to us" (literally "make us hear it") might be an idiom for teaching or explaining, or a form of metonymy where "hearing" stands for "understanding" or "obeying."\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verb הִשְׁמִיעַ (hiphil of שָׁמַע) literally means "to cause to hear," "to proclaim," or "to announce." In the context of a commandment, causing it to be heard is the direct and literal means by which it is communicated, taught, and made known to the people. While hearing often implies understanding and obedience in biblical thought, the verb itself here describes the literal act of communication. It is not a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning (like the examples given for idioms such as "mouth of the sword") nor is it a substitution of a related concept in a figurative way. It\'s a direct description of the act of making the commandment audible and known.\n\n4.  **"that we may observe it" (וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה)**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "observe it" (literally "do it" or "make it") in relation to a commandment might be an idiom for obeying.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verb עָשָׂה ("to do," "to make") is the standard and literal Hebrew term for performing or carrying out a commandment, law, or instruction. It directly refers to the action of fulfilling the requirements of the commandment. This is not a figurative idiom but a literal description of obedience through action.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis and the specific definitions provided for figurative language, I find no clear metaphors, similes, personification, hyperbole, metonymy, or non-literal idioms in this verse.

It describes its inherent accessibility, understandability, and availability to the people. This is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or obvious simile. It is standard narrative language used to convey that the divine instruction is not distant or hidden, but readily within reach of the people\'s comprehension and will. Therefore, I classify this as a literal statement of accessibility, not figurative language.\n\n2.  **"בְּפִ֥יךָ וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖" (in your mouth and in your heart)**\n    *   **What I considered:** This phrase immediately stands out as a strong candidate for figurative language. I considered if it is a metaphor, metonymy, or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:**\n        *   **Metonymy:** "Mouth" (פֶּה) is a common metonymy for speech, utterance, or confession in biblical Hebrew. The "thing" being "in your mouth" signifies that it is something to be spoken, declared, or confessed. Similarly, "heart" (לֵב) is a common metonymy for the inner being, intellect, will, or belief. The "thing" being "in your heart" signifies that it is something to be understood, believed, internalized, and willed.\n        *   **Idiom:** The combination "in your mouth and in your heart" functions as a well-established biblical idiom. It is a set phrase that conveys a comprehensive meaning beyond the literal sum of its parts, signifying complete internalization, understanding, and readiness to act upon the divine command, encompassing both verbal affirmation and inner conviction. This is explicitly supported by its later interpretation in the New Testament (Romans 10:8-10), which draws directly from this passage in Deuteronomy. The guidelines state that "biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase perfectly fits that description.\n    *   **Borderline cases/Debate:** While the individual components ("mouth" and "heart") are metonymic, the phrase as a whole functions as a single idiomatic expression. I have chosen to classify it primarily as an "idiom" because it is a set phrase with a specific, comprehensive meaning, and also acknowledge the underlying "metonymy" for its constituent parts, as the guidelines allow for multiple types.\n\n3.  **"לַעֲשֹׂתֽו" (to observe it/to do it)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "to observe/do" (לַעֲשֹׂתֽו) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a straightforward infinitive construct indicating the purpose or result of the preceding statement. It refers to the literal action of obeying or fulfilling the command. There is no figurative language present here.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the phrase "בְּפִ֥יךָ וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖" (in your mouth and in your heart) is figurative, functioning as both an idiom and containing metonymy.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

This is a common idiomatic usage in Hebrew (and English) to draw the listener\'s attention to an important declaration. The instructions specify that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."

I also considered if "לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" (before your face/in front of you) is a literal spatial description or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The "setting" here is not of physical objects but of abstract concepts (life/death, good/evil). The phrase "לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙" (before your face) is a very common spatial idiom in Hebrew, meaning "in your presence" or "in front of you," often used when presenting choices or information. The entire phrase "I set before you" functions as an idiom for making options or choices available for consideration. This aligns with the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Decision**: Included as an idiom.\n\n3.  **הַיּ֔וֹם (hayyom) - "this day"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "this day" is a literal temporal marker or has a figurative meaning.\n    *   **Reasoning**: "This day" is a straightforward temporal adverb, literally referring to the present moment of the declaration.

It stands for the *result* or *consequence* of choosing the good path. This is a metonymy where the state ("life") represents its associated conditions and comprehensive outcomes.\n    *   **Decision**: Included as metonymy.\n\n5.  **וְאֶת־הַטּ֑וֹב (v\'et ha-tov) - "and prosperity/good"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "good" is a literal description of positive outcomes or used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning**: "Good" (טוב) here is a direct descriptor of the positive choice and its outcomes.

It signifies the comprehensive negative outcomes of disobedience: suffering, destruction, exile, lack of prosperity, and separation from God\'s blessing. It stands for the *result* or *consequence* of choosing the bad path.

It is not used in a figurative sense, but rather literally describes the quality of the path and its results.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.', 'fallback_used': False}

It does not refer to physical locomotion but rather to one\'s moral conduct, lifestyle, or adherence to a set of principles or commands. The physical act of walking on a path serves as a vehicle for the abstract concept of living one\'s life according to God\'s instructions.

In this context, it functions as a **metonymy** for the individual\'s inner self, will, or mind. The action of "turning away" (יִפְנֶה) is not a literal physical movement of the organ but a **metaphor** for a change in allegiance, disposition, or loyalty, specifically away from God. This entire expression is a very common **idiom** in biblical Hebrew to describe spiritual apostasy or a change of heart leading to disobedience. It involves a clear cross-domain comparison (physical turning vs. spiritual disloyalty). While the heart is a human entity, its "turning away" in this non-literal sense could be seen as a subtle personification, but it is more accurately captured by metonymy and metaphor as an idiom for the person\'s internal state.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I debated whether to classify "personification" for the heart "turning away." However, given that the heart is a metonymy for the human will, the action is ultimately attributed to the person\'s internal disposition, making metonymy and metaphor (as an idiom) more precise classifications than personification of a non-human entity.\n\n2.  **וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע (and you give no heed / do not listen):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this might be a figurative idiom or a semantic extension of the verb.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The verb שׁמע (shama\') can mean both "to hear" and "to obey" or "to pay attention to" in Hebrew, especially in the context of divine commands. This is a standard semantic range of the verb, not a clear metaphor, simile, or personification.

In this context, it describes the process of being enticed or led astray into idolatry. While it describes a spiritual process, the verb itself directly conveys this meaning without requiring a cross-domain comparison that would qualify it as a clear metaphor. It\'s a direct description of the consequence of the heart turning away.\n\n4.  **וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֛יתָ לֵאלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים (and you worship other gods):**\n    *   **What I considered:** Literal description.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a direct, literal description of the act of bowing down or worshipping other deities.

It emphasizes the immediacy and present reality of the declaration being made. There is no clear cross-domain comparison or symbolic representation that would elevate it to a metaphor. It remains standard declarative language.\n\n2.  **"כִּ֥י אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵד֑וּן" (that you shall certainly perish)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "perish" (אָבֹד תֹּאבֵדוּן) could be interpreted as hyperbole for severe suffering or a metaphor for spiritual decline rather than literal destruction.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The infinitive absolute construction (אָבֹד תֹּאבֵדוּן) serves to intensify and confirm the certainty of the action. In the context of covenant curses, "perish" refers to the literal destruction, death, or complete removal from the land. It is a direct and literal prediction of a severe consequence, not a symbolic representation of a different concept. The language is strong and emphatic, but it describes a literal outcome.\n\n3.  **"לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙" (you shall not long endure / literally: you shall not lengthen days)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "lengthen days" (תַאֲרִיכֻן יָמִים) is a literal description of manipulating time or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is a well-established and common biblical idiom. Days themselves, as units of time, cannot be literally "lengthened" or "shortened" by human action in the sense of altering their physical duration. Instead, the idiom refers to the duration of one\'s life or presence in a place. To "lengthen days" means to live long or to endure for a long time, while "not lengthening days" means to have a short life or a brief period of endurance. This is a clear instance where the literal meaning of the words (making physical days longer) is not the intended meaning, but rather a conventional, figurative meaning (prolonging life/existence). Furthermore, "days" (יָמִים) here functions metonymically, where a part (units of time) stands for the whole (lifespan or period of existence). This fits the guideline to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and it also contains metonymy.\n    *   **Borderline case debate:** One might argue that it\'s a direct, albeit poetic, way of saying "live long." However, the fixed nature of the phrase and its consistent use across the Hebrew Bible to refer to the *duration* of life rather than the *length* of individual days firmly establishes it as an idiom. The metonymic relationship between "days" and "lifespan" further supports its figurative classification.\n\n4.  **"עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹבֵר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן לָב֥וֹא שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ" (on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "the soil" (הָאֲדָמָה) or the actions of "crossing the Jordan," "entering," and "possessing" are figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These phrases are all literal descriptions of geographical location and physical actions. "הָאֲדָמָה" refers to the physical land. "Crossing the Jordan" is the literal act of traversing the river. "Entering" and "possessing" are literal actions related to taking control and settlement of the land.

They cannot literally observe events, understand legal proceedings, or provide testimony. By invoking them as witnesses, the speaker (God, through Moses) attributes human-like capabilities (witnessing, enduring presence) to non-human entities.

It is a clear cross-domain comparison (inanimate objects performing a human action).\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as personification.\n\n2.  **"I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse" (נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙ הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "putting life and death, blessing and curse before you" is a literal action, a metaphor, or an idiom. While "life," "death," "blessing," and "curse" are real states or outcomes, the act of "putting them before" someone is not literal in the sense of placing physical objects.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom for presenting a choice between two opposing paths or sets of consequences. The abstract concepts of life, death, blessing, and curse are not literally placed as physical items for selection. Instead, the speaker is presenting the *options* or *paths* that lead to these ultimate outcomes. The instruction explicitly states to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type. This fits that criterion perfectly as a standard way of expressing a covenantal choice. It is not a metaphor (as there isn\'t a direct cross-domain comparison of one thing *being* another), nor is it personification.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as idiom.\n\n3.  **"Choose life—if you and your offspring would live" (וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "choose life" or "would live" contains figurative language.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Life" here refers to the literal state of existence, well-being, and flourishing, and "live" refers to the literal act of existing. While "choose life" is a command with profound implications, it is a direct instruction to select the path that leads to this literal state, rather than being a figurative expression itself beyond being part of the larger idiom discussed in point 2. The verb "תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה" (you would live) is used in its straightforward, literal sense.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative in itself, but part of the idiomatic presentation of choices.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

However, in the biblical context, "love" (אהבה) for God is a direct and literal command, encompassing both internal disposition and outward actions. It is a fundamental religious concept expressed directly, not through a cross-domain comparison or an indirect reference. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice): I considered "listening to His voice" (שמע בקולו). While God does not possess a physical voice box in the human sense, the instruction explicitly states that "Divine anthropomorphisms... are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Voice" here refers to divine communication or command, not a specific physical body part. More importantly, "listening to the voice of X" is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "to obey X" or "to heed X\'s commands." The guidelines state to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type. This phrase perfectly fits that description. Therefore, I classified it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him): I considered "holding fast to Him" or "cleaving to Him" (דבק בו). The verb דבק literally means to cling, stick, or cleave physically. When applied to a relationship with God, it is clearly not a physical act of adhesion to a tangible entity. Instead, it uses the physical act of clinging as a vivid image to describe a deep, unwavering spiritual, emotional, and relational commitment to God. This is a clear cross-domain comparison from the physical realm (clinging) to the abstract/spiritual realm (devotion, loyalty). Therefore, I classified it as a metaphor.\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For thereby you shall have life / For He is your life): I considered "He is your life" (הוא חייך). This statement directly identifies God with "life" itself. God is not literally the biological process or state of being alive in a physical sense. Rather, this is a profound metaphorical assertion that God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of true, meaningful, and abundant existence. It\'s a direct equation of the divine entity with the abstract concept of life, representing a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, I classified it as a metaphor.\n\n5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and shall long endure / and the length of your days): I considered "length of your days" (אורך ימיך). This phrase literally refers to a long lifespan. While it is a blessing and a consequence of obedience, it is a direct and literal promise of longevity. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an indirect reference that would qualify it as figurative under the given conservative guidelines. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (upon the soil / to dwell upon the land): This is a literal description of residing in a physical territory. No figurative language is present.\n\n7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם** (that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them): I considered "יהוה swore" (נשבע יהוה). "Swearing" is an act of making a solemn promise. While God does not have a physical mouth or tongue in the human sense, "swearing" is an action attributed to God that signifies divine commitment and reliability. According to the guidelines, "Divine anthropomorphisms... are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Swearing is an action, not a body part. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}
