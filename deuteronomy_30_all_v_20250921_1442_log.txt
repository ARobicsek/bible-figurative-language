It is a conventional way to express the occurrence of events. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and to classify biblical idioms, this expression is considered a standard idiom for "happening to" or "befalling," rather than a clear cross-domain metaphor or personification of the "things" themselves. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **Phrase: הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ (the blessing and the curse that I have set before you)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "set before you" (נתתי לפניך) is a metaphor for presenting options or consequences.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "נתן לפני" (to set before, place before) is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not imply a literal physical placement of abstract concepts like "blessing" and "curse" in front of someone. Instead, it signifies the act of presenting choices, options, or consequences for consideration or experience. As per the instructions, biblical idioms and set phrases are to be classified as "idiom."\n    *   **Decision:** This is marked as figurative (idiom).\n\n3.  **Phrase: וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ (and you take them to heart / return to your heart)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "to heart" (אל לבבך) is a metaphor or metonymy for deep consideration or internalization.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "השיב אל לב" (to return/bring to heart) is a classic and highly frequent biblical idiom. In Hebrew thought, the "heart" (לב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion. To "bring something to heart" or "take to heart" means to reflect deeply on it, to consider it seriously, to internalize it, or to recall it to mind. This is a clear and unambiguous biblical idiom.\n    *   **Decision:** This is marked as figurative (idiom).\n\n4.  **Phrase: בְּכׇ֨ל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה (amidst the various nations to which your God יהוה has banished you)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "banished you" (הדיחך) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "הדיח" (to banish, drive out, scatter) describes a literal action attributed to God, referring to the historical reality of Israel\'s exile. It is a direct statement of divine action and does not employ figurative language. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

It is not a physical journey. This is a well-established biblical idiom for repentance and also functions as a metaphor, using the concept of physical movement (returning to a place or person) to describe a spiritual state or action (returning to a relationship or obedience).\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This is not particularly borderline. The spiritual meaning is dominant and widely understood in such theological contexts.\n\n2.  **"וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ" (and you heed God’s command / listen to His voice)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "listening to His voice" implies a literal auditory perception of a physical sound wave emanating from God, or if it is a figurative expression for obeying His instructions or commands.\n    *   **Reasoning:** As God is understood as a non-corporeal being, He does not possess a physical voice in the human sense that can be literally heard with ears. Therefore, "listening to His voice" is a metonymy where "voice" (קול) stands for the "command," "word," or "instruction" (דבר) that God conveys. It is also a very common and well-understood biblical idiom for obedience.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This is not borderline. It is a standard biblical idiom and metonymy.\n\n3.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ" (with all your heart and soul)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "heart" (לב) and "soul" (נפש) refer to the literal physical organs (the muscular pump and the breath/life force in a purely biological sense) or to the totality of one\'s inner being, intellect, will, emotions, and life force in a holistic sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew anthropology, "heart" (לב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, not merely a physical organ. "Soul" (נפש) refers to the entire self, one\'s life, desires, and inner being. The phrase "with all your heart and soul" is a merism (a figure of speech in which two contrasting parts of a whole are used to represent the whole) and a deeply ingrained idiom signifying complete, wholehearted, and total devotion and commitment, encompassing every aspect of one\'s being. It is not a literal reference to the physical organs in isolation. This is a type of metonymy (specifically synecdoche).\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This is not borderline. It is a foundational idiom for expressing totality of commitment in biblical texts.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

It employs a cognate accusative (the verb שׁוּב "return" with its noun form שְׁבוּת "returning/captivity") to express the reversal of a state of captivity or misfortune, leading to restoration. It does not literally mean to physically "return" a "captivity" as an object, but rather to bring about a complete change in the state of the people. The English footnote "fortunes Others \'captivity.\'" also points to its idiomatic nature. According to the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, this is classified as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None. This is a standard idiomatic expression in biblical Hebrew.\n\n2.  **וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ** (and take you back in love / have compassion on you)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if God "taking you back in love" or "having compassion" is figurative. The English footnote elaborates on an image of a "householder" determining standing.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb רחם (racham) means to show compassion, mercy, or love. God demonstrating these emotions and actions is a standard divine anthropomorphism. The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." This phrase describes God\'s emotional disposition and subsequent action, which is considered literal within the specified context. The "householder" image in the footnote is an interpretive explanation of the *implications* or *cultural context* of God\'s compassion and restoration, rather than a direct figurative meaning of the verb רחם itself. The verb itself is a direct statement of God\'s action/emotion.\n\n3.  **וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים** ([God] will bring you together again from all the peoples)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "gather you from all the peoples" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Gathering" people who have been scattered is a literal action of bringing dispersed individuals back to a central location or community. This is a direct, literal action God will perform.\n\n4.  **אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה** (where your God יהוה has scattered you.)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "scattered you" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Scattering" people is a literal action, referring to their dispersion across different lands or among different nations. This is a direct, literal action God performed.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only the idiom שׁוּב אֶת־שְׁבוּת is identified as figurative language.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

However, this term literally describes the state of the dispersed Israelites. It is a direct and accurate descriptor of their condition, not a figurative comparison or representation. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative language.\n\n2.  **"בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם" (biq\'tseh hashshamayim) - "at the ends of the sky/heavens" (translated as "at the ends of the world")**: This phrase was the primary focus for figurative analysis.\n    *   **Considered if literal**: I first considered if "ends of the sky" could be interpreted as a literal geographical location. This was quickly dismissed, as the "ends of the sky" is not a physical place one can reach on earth.\n    *   **Reasoning for Hyperbole**: The phrase clearly exaggerates the extent of the dispersion. It implies a distance so vast that it reaches the very limits of the perceived universe, far beyond any actual geographical point on earth. This exaggeration serves to emphasize the extreme and widespread nature of the future exile, making it a clear instance of hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning for Metonymy**: "Ends of the sky" functions as a metonymy where the perceived boundary of the celestial realm stands in for the furthest possible reaches of the terrestrial world. It is not literally the sky that is being referred to as a place of exile, but rather the most remote parts of the earth, represented by the conceptual "ends of the sky."\n    *   **Reasoning for Idiom**: This expression is a well-established biblical idiom used to denote extreme distance or the furthest possible location. It is a set phrase that conveys the idea of "the ends of the earth" or "the remotest corners of the world." As per instructions, figurative idioms are to be classified as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Borderline cases/Debate**: While it could be argued that it\'s simply a poetic way of saying "very far," the exaggeration and the substitution of "sky" for "earth\'s furthest reaches" firmly place it within hyperbole and metonymy, and its common usage makes it an idiom. I am confident in classifying it as all three.\n\n3.  **"יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" (yeqabbetz\'kha YHWH Elohekha) - "your God יהוה will gather you"**: I considered if "gather" might be a metaphor for spiritual restoration or a less direct form of reunification. However, in the context of a dispersed people, "gathering" them is a literal action of bringing them back together from various locations. This is a standard divine action described literally in the ANE context. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative language.\n\n4.  **"וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ" (umishsham yiqqakhekha) - "and from there [God] will fetch you"**: I considered if "fetch/take" might be figurative. Similar to "gather," this refers to the literal act of God bringing the dispersed people back to their land. It is a direct action, not a figurative representation. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative language.', 'fallback_used': False}

However, here it is applied to "the heart" (לְבָבְךָ֖), which in Hebrew thought is understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, not a physical organ to be literally cut in this manner. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison, where a physical action (circumcision) is applied to an abstract, spiritual, or internal entity (the heart\'s spiritual state). Therefore, it functions as a **metaphor**. Furthermore, "circumcision of the heart" is a well-established phrase in biblical literature (e.g., Deut 10:16, Jer 4:4), carrying the specific, non-literal meaning of spiritual purification, removal of spiritual hardness or resistance, and making the heart receptive to God\'s will and love. As such, it also functions as a **biblical idiom**. The English translation note "open up*open up Others “circumcise.”" implicitly acknowledges this figurative usage by offering an interpretive rendering while retaining the literal root.\n\n2.  **"וְאֶת־לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ" (and the hearts of your offspring)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If this phrase, in conjunction with the verb "circumcise," is also figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This phrase is a direct parallel and extension of "your heart" in the preceding clause. The same metaphorical and idiomatic application of "circumcision" to the "heart" applies to the "hearts of your offspring." It refers to the spiritual transformation of future generations.\n\n3.  **"לְבָבְךָ֖" (your heart) and "לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ" (the hearts of your offspring) in isolation**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) itself, as the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, is a metonymy for the inner person.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While "heart" can sometimes function as a synecdoche for the whole person or the inner being, in the context of Hebrew thought, the "heart" is literally understood as the center of one\'s inner life (thoughts, intentions, emotions, will). It is not a cross-domain comparison in itself. The figurative nature arises from the *action* performed upon it (circumcision), not from the term "heart" itself being used to represent something else entirely. Therefore, I am not marking "heart" in isolation as figurative here, but rather the *combination* of "circumcise" with "heart."\n\n4.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥" (with all your heart) and "וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖" (and with all your soul)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If these expressions of totality are figurative (e.g., hyperbole, metonymy).\n    *   **Reasoning**: "With all your heart" and "with all your soul" are standard biblical expressions emphasizing complete and undivided devotion. In Hebrew understanding, the "heart" (לֵבָב) encompasses one\'s intellect, will, and emotions, and "soul" (נֶפֶשׁ) refers to one\'s very life and being. To love with "all" of these faculties is a literal statement of the extent and totality of one\'s commitment, not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or exaggeration beyond what is intended. They are not clear metaphors or similes. They are literal statements of complete devotion according to the Hebrew understanding of these terms. Therefore, these are not marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

While "inflict" in English might suggest a physical action, the Hebrew verb נָתַן (natan) is very broad and commonly used for "giving" or "placing" non-physical entities like blessings, laws, or punishments.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a standard and literal usage of the verb נָתַן in Hebrew to describe the divine act of bringing about a consequence or condition. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor) nor a fixed, non-literal phrase (idiom) in the sense of "face of the earth." Furthermore, the action of God "inflicting" or "giving" curses falls under the category of divine anthropomorphisms (God acting), which the instructions explicitly state are to be treated as LITERAL in the ANE context, unless they refer to a specific body part of God. This phrase does not refer to a body part.\n\n2.  **"עַל־אֹיְבֶ֥יךָ וְעַל־שֹׂנְאֶ֖יךָ" (upon your enemies and upon your foes):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the preposition עַל (al), translated as "upon," is used figuratively here. Curses are not physical objects that are literally placed "on" someone.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The preposition עַל is frequently used in Hebrew to indicate the recipient or target of an action, especially when that action has a negative impact or consequence. For example, "sin is upon him" or "blood is upon him." This is a standard grammatical function of the preposition, indicating that the curses will fall *on* or *affect* the enemies, rather than a figurative comparison or non-literal expression. It is not a metaphor or metonymy.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר רְדָפֽוּךָ" (who persecuted you):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the verb רָדַף (radaf), meaning "to pursue" or "to persecute," is used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of the actions of the enemies. They actively pursued and harassed the Israelites, which is the direct meaning of "persecuted." There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended here.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a conservative analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, or distinct biblical idioms (beyond standard grammatical usage) are present in this verse.

The instructions emphasize being conservative with standard narrative language and not marking proportional or behavioral comparisons as figurative. This usage falls into the category of standard theological/behavioral language rather than a clear cross-domain metaphor. Therefore, I am not marking it as figurative.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will hear/heed the voice of YHWH):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה" (the voice of YHWH) is a literal audible voice or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, the phrase "שָׁמַע בְּקוֹל" (to hear/heed the voice of) is a well-established idiom meaning to obey, comply with, or pay attention to the commands or instructions of someone, especially God. It is not necessarily about perceiving an audible sound, but about submitting to authority or following divine will. The instruction explicitly states to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom." Furthermore, "voice" here functions metonymically, where the means of communication (the voice) stands for the message or command itself. This is a clear instance of both an idiom and metonymy.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** While "voice" can be an anthropomorphism, the instruction specifies that divine anthropomorphisms are literal *unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)*. "Voice" is an attribute, but the *phrase* "hear the voice of YHWH" is primarily idiomatic for obedience, which is the key figurative element here, rather than a literal description of God\'s physical vocal cords.

However, it is a straightforward declaration of God\'s intention to bless, falling under standard narrative language and divine action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **בְּכֹ֣ל׀ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֗ךָ** ("in all your undertakings" / lit. "in all the work of your hand"): I considered if "work of your hand" (מַעֲשֵׂה יָדֶךָ) is a literal reference to manual labor or a broader figurative expression. I determined that "hand" (יָד) here functions as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche) where a part (the hand) represents the whole of one\'s efforts, labor, or endeavors. This is a common and fixed expression in biblical Hebrew, signifying all one\'s activities and accomplishments, not just those performed literally by the physical hand. As such, it is classified as an idiom.\n\n3.  **בִּפְרִ֨י בִטְנְךָ֜** ("in your issue from the womb" / lit. "in the fruit of your womb"): I considered if "fruit of your womb" (פְרִֽי בִטְנְךָ) is a literal description. It is a clear and widely recognized metaphor for children. Children are not literally "fruit"; the term draws a comparison between the reproductive outcome of a plant (fruit) and the reproductive outcome of a human (offspring). This is a distinct cross-domain comparison.\n\n4.  **וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛** ("the offspring of your cattle" / lit. "and in the fruit of your cattle"): I considered if "fruit of your cattle" (פְרִֽי בְהֶמְתְּךָ) is figurative. While "fruit" often refers to plant produce, the Hebrew word פְּרִי (peri) directly means "fruit, produce, offspring" and is used literally for the offspring of animals as well as humans and the produce of the earth. Therefore, "offspring of your cattle" is a literal meaning of the term and not figurative.\n\n5.  **וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖** ("and your produce from the soil" / lit. "and in the fruit of your ground"): I considered if "fruit of your ground" (פְרִֽי אַדְמָתְךָ) is figurative. This is a literal reference to agricultural produce, which is a primary meaning of פְּרִי. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n6.  **לְטֹבָ֑ה** ("for well-being" / lit. "for good"): This is a standard adverbial phrase and is literal.\n\n7.  **כִּ֣י׀ יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב** ("For יהוה will again delight in your well-being" / lit. "For יהוה will return to rejoice over you for good"): I considered if God "rejoicing" (לָשׂוּשׂ) is figurative. According to the guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms (like God being angry, watching, or rejoicing) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body parts. Rejoicing is an emotion and an action, not a specific body part. Therefore, this is treated as a literal divine anthropomorphism.\n\n8.  **כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ** ("as in that of your ancestors" / lit. "as he rejoiced over your ancestors"): I considered if this comparison is a simile. The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase is a behavioral comparison, stating that God\'s future rejoicing will be *like* his past rejoicing over their ancestors. It is a literal comparison of divine actions, not a figurative simile.\n\nIn summary, I identified two instances of figurative language: an idiom (which includes metonymy) and a metaphor.\n\n---', 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies compliance and submission to authority, extending beyond mere physical hearing. This falls under the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None; this is a clear and standard biblical idiom.\n\n2.  **"לִשְׁמֹ֤ר מִצְוֺתָיו֙ וְחֻקֹּתָ֔יו הַכְּתוּבָ֕ה בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֖ה הַזֶּ֑ה"** (and keeping the divine commandments and laws that are recorded in this book of the Teaching)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "keeping commandments and laws" or "recorded in this book" contained any figurative elements.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** These phrases describe literal actions (keeping/observing) and literal facts (being written in a book). There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.\n\n3.  **"כִּ֤י תָשׁוּב֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ"** (once you return to your God יהוה)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "תָשׁוּב֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה" (tashuv el YHWH, "return to YHWH") refers to a literal physical return or a metaphorical spiritual turning.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** While the verb "שׁוּב" (shuv) can denote physical return, in the context of returning *to God*, it consistently carries the theological meaning of repentance, spiritual reorientation, or renewed commitment to the covenant relationship. One does not physically "return" to God in the same way one returns to a geographical location. This is a clear metaphor where physical movement is used to describe a spiritual or relational change.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** While "return" can be broadly understood as "returning to the right path," the spiritual and relational dimension is so central to this phrase that it functions as a metaphor for repentance and reconciliation.\n\n4.  **"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖"** (with all your heart)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "לְבָבְךָ֖" (levavcha, "your heart") refers literally to the physical organ or figuratively to the inner being, intellect, will, and emotions. I also considered if the entire phrase "בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖" (with all your heart) functions as an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral decision-making, not merely the circulatory organ. Therefore, using "heart" to represent these faculties or the entire inner person is a form of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part stands for the whole inner being).

To act "with all your nefesh" means with your entire life, your deepest self, your full vitality.

By using the verb לָקַח, the text treats the abstract commandment as if it were a tangible item that can be physically retrieved.

My reasoning for excluding it is that it is a straightforward, literal statement of divine instruction given on a specific day. There is no metaphorical extension, personification, or idiomatic usage present.\n\n2.  **"לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙" (to love your God יהוה):** I considered if "love" here might be a metaphor for mere obedience or a specific type of devotion that isn\'t genuinely emotional. My reasoning for excluding it as figurative is that "love" (אהבה) in this context, while certainly encompassing obedience and loyalty, is understood as a genuine, profound emotional and volitional commitment. It is a direct command for a spiritual and relational state, not a symbolic representation of something else.\n\n3.  **"לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו" (to walk in God’s ways):** I considered this phrase carefully as a potential idiom and metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This is a clear instance of figurative language. The verb "לָלֶכֶת" (to walk) is not meant literally as a physical locomotion. Instead, it is a **metaphor** for one\'s conduct, lifestyle, and adherence to God\'s principles. Similarly, "בִּדְרָכָיו" (in His ways/paths) refers not to literal physical roads but to the abstract course of action, moral principles, or divine decrees. This phrase also functions as a well-established **idiom** in biblical Hebrew, signifying living in accordance with God\'s will and following His prescribed manner of life. It represents a cross-domain comparison where the physical act of moving along a path is used to describe moral and spiritual conduct.\n\n4.  **"וְלִשְׁמֹ֛ר מִצְוֺתָ֥יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֖יו וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֑יו" (and to keep God’s commandments, God’s laws, and God’s rules):** I considered if "to keep" (לשמור) might be figurative, perhaps a metonymy for "obey." My reasoning for excluding it is that "to keep" here means to observe, guard, or obey, which is a literal and standard meaning of the verb in the context of laws and commands. The "commandments, laws, and rules" themselves are literal categories of divine instruction.\n\n5.  **"וְחָיִ֣יתָ וְרָבִ֔יתָ" (that you may thrive and increase):** I considered if "thrive" (חיה) or "increase" (רבה) could be hyperbole, given the promise of abundant life and progeny. My reasoning for excluding them is that these are literal promises of well-being, prosperity, and population growth, which are direct and tangible consequences of obedience in the biblical narrative. They describe real-world outcomes, not exaggerated or symbolic ones.\n\n6.  **"וּבֵֽרַכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ" (and that your God יהוה may bless you):** I considered if "to bless" (ברך) might be figurative, perhaps a metonymy for the effects of blessing. My reasoning for excluding it is that divine blessing is a literal theological concept in the Bible, referring to God\'s direct action of bestowing favor, prosperity, and well-being. It is a direct divine act, not a symbolic representation.\n\n7.  **"בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ" (in the land that you are about to enter and possess):** I considered if "land," "enter," or "possess" might be figurative, perhaps referring to a spiritual inheritance. My reasoning for excluding them is that these are all literal terms referring to a physical geographical location (the Promised Land) and the literal actions of moving into and taking ownership of that territory.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only "לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו" (to walk in God’s ways) qualifies as figurative language, functioning as both an idiom and a metaphor.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

When it "turns away" (יִפְנֶה), it refers to a change in one\'s inner disposition, allegiance, or will, moving away from a prescribed path or loyalty to God. This is not the physical organ literally turning. Instead, it functions as a metonymy, where the "heart" (a part) stands for the entire inner person\'s will, intention, or moral center (the whole). It is also a very common biblical idiom for spiritual apostasy or disloyalty. It is not personification because the "heart" in this context is inherently understood to possess these faculties of will and decision-making within the Hebrew worldview, rather than attributing human qualities to an inanimate object.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The distinction between a deeply ingrained idiom and a subtle metaphor can sometimes be debated. However, given the consistent use of "heart" in Hebrew to denote the inner person\'s will and thought, its "turning" is best understood as a metonymic idiom rather than a fresh, cross-domain comparison (metaphor) or attributing human action to an inanimate object (personification).\n\n2.  **וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע** (and you give no heed / do not listen):\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "not listen" could be figurative, perhaps metonymy for "not obey."\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** While "listening" (שָׁמַע) often implies obedience in biblical contexts, in this specific phrase, "give no heed" or "do not listen" directly describes the act of not paying attention or disregarding a command. It\'s a literal description of an action or inaction that leads to further consequences. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or attribution of human qualities to non-human entities.\n\n3.  **וְנִדַּחְתָּ֗** (and are lured / driven away / led astray):\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "lured" or "driven away" might be a metaphor for spiritual deviation.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** The verb נדח (niddach) means to be driven away, banished, or led astray. In this context, it describes the consequence of the heart turning away – being led astray from the correct path or divine instruction. It is a direct description of being influenced or moved from a proper spiritual/moral position, not a metaphorical comparison to a different domain.\n\n4.  **וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֛יתָ לֵאלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים וַעֲבַדְתָּֽם** (and you worship and serve other gods):\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "worship and serve" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** This is a literal description of idolatrous actions. "Worship" (הִשְׁתַּחֲוִיתָ - to bow down) and "serve" (וַעֲבַדְתָּם - to work for/serve) are direct, physical, and spiritual actions directed towards other deities. There is no figurative language present here.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "if your heart turns away" is identified as figurative.\n\n```json', 'fallback_used': False}

However, in biblical narrative and speech, "this day" is consistently used as a literal temporal marker, indicating the specific time the declaration is being made. It functions as standard narrative language and is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵד֑וּן" (you shall certainly perish / you shall utterly perish)**: I considered if the infinitive absolute construction, which serves to intensify the verb, could be classified as hyperbole. While it strongly emphasizes the certainty and totality of the perishing, it is a standard grammatical device for emphasis in Hebrew, not an exaggeration beyond what is literally possible or intended. It conveys a literal, emphatic consequence rather than a figurative overstatement. Therefore, I am not marking it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"לֹא־תַאֲרִיכֻ֤ן יָמִים֙" (you shall not long endure / you shall not lengthen days)**: I considered this phrase as a potential idiom. The literal translation "you shall not lengthen days" does not fully capture the meaning in English. In biblical Hebrew, "הֶאֱרִיךְ יָמִים" (to lengthen days) is a well-established idiom meaning "to live long" or "to endure for a long time." The term "days" (יָמִים) here metonymically represents the span or duration of life or existence. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom as a set phrase with a non-literal, conventional meaning, and it also contains a metonymic element. Therefore, I am marking this as both an idiom and metonymy.\n\n4.  **"עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה" (on the soil / on the land)**: I considered if "the land" might be used metonymically to refer to the people or the nation. However, in this context, it refers literally to the physical territory upon which they will reside. The statement is about their physical presence and duration *on* the land, not about the land itself standing in for its inhabitants. It is a literal geographical reference.\n\n5.  **"אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹבֵר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן" (that you are crossing the Jordan)**: I considered if "crossing the Jordan" could be an idiom for entering the Promised Land. While it is a pivotal and symbolic act of entry, the phrase itself describes a literal physical action – the act of traversing the Jordan River. It is a direct description of the means by which they will enter the land, not a figurative expression for the entry itself.\n\n6.  **"לָב֥וֹא שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ" (to enter and possess it)**: I considered these verbs as literal actions. "To enter" and "to possess" are direct, literal descriptions of the intended actions of the people regarding the land. They are not used in a figurative sense.', 'fallback_used': False}

Attributing the human action of "witnessing" to these non-human objects is a clear instance of personification. This is a common biblical trope used to underscore the solemnity, permanence, and universal scope of a divine declaration or covenant, invoking the enduring cosmos as an impartial observer. Furthermore, this specific phrase is a well-established biblical idiom (e.g., Deut 4:26, 31:28, Isa 1:2). Therefore, it functions as both an idiom and contains personification.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I considered if "heaven and earth" could also be interpreted as metonymy (specifically a merism, where the parts represent the whole of creation). While "heaven and earth" often serves as a merism for the entire cosmos, the primary figurative device in the *act* of "witnessing" is personification. Given the instructions to mark "personification of non-human entities" and "biblical idioms," both are applicable here.\n\n2.  **"נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ" (I have put before you)** in the context of "הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה" (I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse).\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "put before you" is a literal action or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** God does not literally place physical objects representing "life," "death," "blessing," or "curse" in front of the people. This phrase is an idiomatic expression in Hebrew meaning "to present options," "to offer choices," or "to set out alternatives." It describes the act of making different paths or outcomes available for selection. Therefore, it is an idiom. The abstract concepts of "life and death, blessing and curse" themselves are not figurative; they are the literal abstract choices being presented.\n\n3.  **"הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙" (life and death)** and **"הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה" (blessing and curse)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether these abstract concepts are figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are literal abstract concepts representing outcomes or states of being. They are not being used to represent something else in a metaphorical sense, nor are they personified. They are the direct objects of the idiomatic "put before you."\n\n4.  **"וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ" (Choose life—if you and your offspring would live—)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "choose life" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct command to select the path or course of action that leads to the desired outcome of "life."

While the *expression* of love for God might involve various actions, the concept of love itself is understood literally in this context as devotion and loyalty. It is not a cross-domain comparison or an established idiom for something else.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n2.  **לִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹל֖וֹ** (heeding God’s commands / listening to His voice):\n    *   **Considered:** If "listening to His voice" (שמע בקולו) is a literal act of hearing a sound or a figurative expression.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, "to hear/listen to the voice of X" (שמע בקול X) is a well-established idiom meaning "to obey," "to heed the commands of," or "to comply with the will of X." God, being incorporeal, does not possess a physical voice in the human sense that one literally "hears" with ears. Therefore, "voice" here metonymically represents God\'s commands, instructions, or will. The instruction explicitly states, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase fits both as an idiom and a metonymy.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Figurative (Idiom, Metonymy).\n\n3.  **וּלְדׇבְקָה־ב֑וֹ** (and holding fast to [God] / cleaving to Him):\n    *   **Considered:** If "holding fast to Him" (דבק בו) is a literal physical action or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb דבק (dabaq) literally means to cling, stick, or cleave. When applied to God, it is a clear metaphor. One cannot physically "cling" or "stick" to an incorporeal divine being. Instead, the physical act of clinging (vehicle) is used to describe a profound spiritual and relational state of unwavering loyalty, devotion, and commitment (tenor) to God. It\'s a cross-domain comparison.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Figurative (Metaphor).\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י ה֤וּא חַיֶּ֙יךָ֙** (For thereby you shall have life / For He is your life):\n    *   **Considered:** If "He is your life" (הוא חייך) is a literal statement or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct identification, a metaphor. God is not literally the biological process or the state of being alive in a physical sense. Rather, God is presented as the ultimate source, sustainer, and essence of true, meaningful, and abundant life. The divine being (tenor) is equated with the abstract concept of life (vehicle), indicating that life\'s quality and duration are entirely dependent on and derived from God.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Figurative (Metaphor).\n\n5.  **וְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמֶ֔יךָ** (and shall long endure / and the length of your days):\n    *   **Considered:** If "length of your days" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This refers to longevity, a literal outcome or state of being. It is a direct and literal description of extended lifespan.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n6.  **לָשֶׁ֣בֶת עַל־הָאֲדָמָ֗ה** (to dwell upon the soil / to live on the land):\n    *   **Considered:** If "to dwell upon the land" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal action and state of residing in a physical location.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n7.  **אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֛יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֛ם לְיִצְחָ֥ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֖ב לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם** (that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them):\n    *   **Considered:** If "swore" (נִשְׁבַּע) is an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instruction states that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Swearing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. In the ANE context, such divine actions are understood literally as God\'s engagement with the world.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative. The rest of the phrase refers to literal historical figures and a literal promise.', 'fallback_used': False}
