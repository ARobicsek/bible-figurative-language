It also highlights the continuity and reinterpretation of covenant signs from physical to spiritual realms.\n\n*   **For \"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖\" (with all your heart and soul):**\n    *   **TARGET**: The target is the totality and completeness of a person's devotion, commitment, and inner being. It refers to the unreserved nature of their love for God.\n    *   **VEHICLE**: The vehicle uses two primary components of human inner life – \"heart\" (representing intellect, will, emotion) and \"soul\" (representing life force, desires, inner self) – to represent the whole person. This is a merism.\n    *   **GROUND**: The underlying quality illuminated is the requirement for unreserved, undivided, and comprehensive love and loyalty towards God. It emphasizes that no part of one's being should be withheld, signifying absolute dedication.\n    *   **SPEAKER POSTURE**: The speaker's posture is one of divine instruction and expectation, setting a high standard for the covenant relationship and emphasizing the depth of commitment required from the people.\n    *   **Scholarly Research**: This tagging helps scholars identify recurring idioms and merisms related to devotion and totality in biblical literature. It allows for comparative studies of how different biblical texts express complete commitment, whether through such fixed phrases or other rhetorical devices. It can reveal the cultural and theological emphasis on holistic devotion in ancient Israelite religion and how such expressions contribute to the ethical and theological framework of the covenant, enabling cross-textual analysis of the demands of divine-human relationship.\n\n```json",

Therefore, it is marked as figurative (idiom, metaphor, metonymy).\n\n3.  **`וּבִפְרִ֧י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֛` (fruit of your cattle / offspring of your cattle)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"fruit of your cattle\" is a literal description or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to \"fruit of the womb,\" \"fruit\" (פְּרִי) is here applied to the offspring of animals. While animals produce offspring, they do not produce \"fruit\" in the literal botanical sense. This is a metaphorical extension, comparing animal offspring to the valuable yield or product, much like the fruit of a plant. Therefore, it is marked as figurative (metaphor).\n\n4.  **`וּבִפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖` (produce from the soil / fruit of your ground)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"fruit of your ground\" is a literal description or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** \"Fruit\" (פְּרִי) in this context refers to agricultural produce from the soil. This is a literal and primary meaning of *p'ri* (produce, yield from the earth). Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **`יָשׁ֣וּב יְהֹוָ֗ה לָשׂ֤וּשׂ עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לְט֔וֹב` (יהוה will again delight in your well-being / יהוה will return to rejoice over you for good)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"God will return\" or \"God will rejoice\" are anthropomorphisms that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state that \"Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger).\" Neither \"return\" nor \"rejoice\" refers to a specific body part of God. They describe God's actions and emotions/disposition. Therefore, according to the given constraints, these are to be considered literal and not marked as figurative.\n\n6.  **`כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֖שׂ עַל־אֲבֹתֶֽיךָ` (as in that of your ancestors / as he rejoiced over your fathers)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this comparison is a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: \"NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'.\" This phrase is a behavioral comparison (\"as he rejoiced over your fathers\").

It emphasizes obedience, alignment with divine will, and a journey of righteousness.\n*   **SPEAKER POSTURE**: The speaker (Moses, delivering God's command) is in a posture of **instruction and exhortation**. The language is prescriptive, guiding the people towards a specific, desired way of life. It carries a sense of divine expectation, authoritative guidance, and a call to righteous living.\n\nThese hierarchical tags enable scholarly research and pattern discovery by:\n1.  **Categorizing conceptual mappings**: By identifying \"moral conduct\" as the target and \"physical movement/path\" as the vehicle, scholars can systematically study how abstract ethical concepts are concretized through spatial metaphors across the biblical corpus.\n2.  **Tracing idiomatic usage**: Tagging it as an \"idiom\" allows for the collection and analysis of all instances of this specific set phrase, revealing its prevalence, variations, and contextual nuances.\n3.  **Analyzing rhetorical strategies**: The \"posture\" tags (instruction, exhortation) help researchers understand how figurative language is employed to persuade, command, or teach, and how this might differ in various genres (e.g., law, prophecy, wisdom literature).\n4.  **Exploring theological implications**: The \"ground\" tags (adherence to principles, obedience, righteous living) illuminate the specific aspects of divine-human relationship and expected behavior that the metaphor emphasizes, contributing to a deeper understanding of biblical theology.\n5.  **Facilitating comparative studies**: These structured tags allow for cross-linguistic and cross-cultural comparisons of similar conceptual metaphors, highlighting both unique and universal patterns in human thought and expression.\n6.  **Enabling computational analysis**: The hierarchical and structured nature of the tags makes them ideal for computational tools, allowing for large-scale data mining and the identification of patterns that might be missed through manual analysis, such as the correlation between specific metaphors and particular divine commands or promises.\n\n```json",

However, in biblical Hebrew, \"love\" (אהבה) often encompasses both affection and loyalty/obedience as a direct command for a comprehensive relationship. It is a literal command for an internal state and its outward expression, rather than a figurative representation of something else. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n*   **\"לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו\" (to walk in God’s ways)**: I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor and idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: The literal meaning of \"walk\" (לָלֶכֶת) refers to physical locomotion, and \"ways\" (דְּרָכָיו) refers to physical paths or roads. However, the context clearly indicates that the command is not to physically traverse paths belonging to God, but to conduct one's life according to God's moral and ethical principles, His commands, and His character. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where physical movement along a path is used to represent moral conduct or a way of life. It is also a very common and established idiom in biblical Hebrew for living righteously and adhering to divine instructions. This phrase is therefore marked as both a metaphor and an idiom.\n*   **\"וְלִשְׁמֹ֛ר מִצְוֺתָ֥יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֖יו וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֑יו\" (and to keep God’s commandments, God’s laws, and God’s rules)**: I considered if \"keep\" (לִשְׁמֹר) might be figurative. \"To keep\" can mean to guard, observe, or obey. In this context, it means to observe or obey the divine decrees. This is a standard, literal usage of the verb in relation to laws and commands, not a figurative one. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n*   **\"וְחָיִ֣יתָ וְרָבִ֔יתָ\" (that you may thrive and increase)**: I considered if \"thrive and increase\" might be hyperbole or a metaphor for general prosperity. However, these are literal outcomes of blessing and obedience in the ancient Near Eastern context, referring to a long life, health, and progeny. They are direct descriptions of desired states, not figurative. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n*   **\"וּבֵֽרַכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ\" (and that your God יהוה may bless you)**: I considered if \"bless\" (בֵּרַכְךָ) could be figurative. While the *effects* of blessing are often abstract (prosperity, favor), the act of God blessing is presented as a direct, literal divine action in the biblical worldview. It is not a metaphor for something else, nor is it an anthropomorphism referring to God's body. It is a statement of divine agency. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n*   **\"בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ\" (in the land that you are about to enter and possess)**: This is a literal description of the geographical location and the action of taking possession.
