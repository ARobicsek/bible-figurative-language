However, in biblical Hebrew, this is a very common and standard way to express that events or circumstances happen to someone. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal meaning beyond the standard usage of \"happen to\" or \"come upon.\" Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative language, classifying it as standard narrative language.\n\n2.  **\"הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ\" (the blessing and the curse that I have set before you)**: I considered \"נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ\" (I have set before you) as a potential idiom. This phrase literally means \"I have given/placed before your face.\" However, in this context, it clearly refers to God presenting choices, options, or consequences to Israel, not literally placing physical objects in front of them. This is a well-established biblical idiom for making something available for consideration or choice. It fits the definition of a biblical idiom that conveys a meaning beyond the literal combination of its words. Therefore, I am including it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **\"וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ\" (and you take them to heart / and you return to your heart)**: I considered this phrase as a clear idiom. \"אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ\" (to your heart) uses the heart as the metaphorical seat of thought, memory, and will. \"וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙\" (and you will return/bring back) in this context means to reflect deeply, consider, remember, or internalize. The phrase as a whole signifies a process of deep internal consideration and reflection, not a literal physical action of returning something to the anatomical heart. This is a very common and well-understood biblical idiom. Therefore, I am including it as an idiom.\n\n4.  **\"בְּכׇ֨ל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה\" (amidst the various nations to which your God יהוה has banished you)**: I considered if \"הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ\" (YHWH your God has banished you) might be figurative. However, this is a direct statement of God's action of driving out or exiling the people.

Instead, it signifies a spiritual or relational turning back to God, indicating repentance, renewed obedience, or a restoration of a relationship after a period of straying. This is a conventionalized expression in biblical Hebrew for a spiritual action, making it a well-established idiom. It is not a clear cross-domain comparison that would strictly classify it as a metaphor, but rather a standard way of expressing this theological concept. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ / and you heed God’s command (lit. \"listen to His voice\")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"listen to His voice\" might be a metaphor for obedience or a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While God communicates, the phrase \"His voice\" (קֹלוֹ) here does not refer to an audible sound produced by physical vocal cords that can be heard by human ears in the same way one hears another person. Instead, \"His voice\" represents God's commands, instructions, or divine will. To \"listen to His voice\" is a widely recognized biblical idiom for obeying God's commands or heeding His instructions. It's a conventional way of expressing submission and obedience to divine authority. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ / with all your heart and soul**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"with all your heart and soul\" might be a merism, synecdoche, or a general idiom for complete devotion.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew anthropology, \"heart\" (לֵבָב) represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, and \"soul\" (נֶפֶשׁ) refers to the life-force, inner being, or self. The combination of these two significant terms is a very common biblical idiom (specifically, a merism, which is a type of idiom) used to express the totality of a person's being. It signifies complete, undivided commitment, devotion, or wholeheartedness. It is not meant to be taken literally as using only these two specific internal components, but rather the entirety of one's inner self. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.",

Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ / and you heed God’s command (lit. \"listen to His voice\")**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"listen to His voice\" might be a metaphor for obedience or a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While God communicates, the phrase \"His voice\" (קֹלוֹ) here does not refer to an audible sound produced by physical vocal cords that can be heard by human ears in the same way one hears another person. Instead, \"His voice\" represents God's commands, instructions, or divine will. To \"listen to His voice\" is a widely recognized biblical idiom for obeying God's commands or heeding His instructions. It's a conventional way of expressing submission and obedience to divine authority. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ / with all your heart and soul**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if \"with all your heart and soul\" might be a merism, synecdoche, or a general idiom for complete devotion.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew anthropology, \"heart\" (לֵבָב) represents the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, and \"soul\" (נֶפֶשׁ) refers to the life-force, inner being, or self. The combination of these two significant terms is a very common biblical idiom (specifically, a merism, which is a type of idiom) used to express the totality of a person's being. It signifies complete, undivided commitment, devotion, or wholeheartedness. It is not meant to be taken literally as using only these two specific internal components, but rather the entirety of one's inner self. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\nTAGGING_ANALYSIS:\n1.  **Hebrew phrase:** וְשַׁבְתָּ֞ עַד־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙\n    **English phrase:** and you return to your God יהוה\n    *   **TARGET:** The spiritual act of repentance, turning away from sin, and renewing one's commitment or relationship with God.\n    *   **VEHICLE:** The physical action of \"returning\" or \"turning back\" to a previous location or state.\n    *   **GROUND:** The underlying concept of changing direction, reversing a course of action, or re-establishing a connection after a period of separation or straying.

This is a well-established conceptual metaphor in biblical Hebrew, where a physical act of turning is used to represent a change in spiritual direction or allegiance. Because this usage is so common and standardized for \"repentance\" or \"turning back to God,\" it functions as a biblical idiom. It is not a literal physical turning of the body. Therefore, it is classified as both a metaphor (due to the cross-domain mapping) and an idiom (due to its conventionalized use).\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will hear/heed the voice of YHWH):\n    *   Considered if 'בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה' (the voice of YHWH) refers to an audible sound in the human sense or a figurative representation of divine communication.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase is a classic biblical idiom. It is a metonymy where \"voice\" (the means of communication) stands for God's divine commands, instructions, or will (the content of communication). To \"heed the voice of YHWH\" means to obey His word or law, not necessarily to perceive an audible sound. The instructions explicitly list \"פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה\" (mouth of YHWH) as an example of an idiom, and \"ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה\" functions identically as a metonymic idiom for divine communication. While God can speak audibly, in this context, it refers to the substance of His directives. Therefore, it is classified as both a metonymy and an idiom.\n\n3.  **וְעָשִׂ֙יתָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם** (and obey all the divine commandments that I enjoin upon you this day):\n    *   Considered if any part of this phrase is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: \"Obey all His commandments\" and \"I command you this day\" are straightforward, literal statements describing actions and divine instruction. No figurative language is detected in this part of the verse.",

        "llm_deliberation": "FIGURATIVE_DETECTION:\n1.  **וְאַתָּ֣ה תָשׁ֔וּב** (You, however, will again return/turn back):\n    *   Considered if 'תָשׁוּב' (return/turn back) in the context of turning to God is a literal physical movement or a figurative expression.\n    *   Reasoning: While the verb שׁוּב literally means \"to turn\" or \"to return,\" its usage here, in conjunction with \"hearing the voice of YHWH\" and obeying commandments, clearly indicates a spiritual or moral turning, i.e., repentance. This is a well-established conceptual metaphor in biblical Hebrew, where a physical act of turning is used to represent a change in spiritual direction or allegiance. Because this usage is so common and standardized for \"repentance\" or \"turning back to God,\" it functions as a biblical idiom. It is not a literal physical turning of the body. Therefore, it is classified as both a metaphor (due to the cross-domain mapping) and an idiom (due to its conventionalized use).\n\n2.  **וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֖ בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and you will hear/heed the voice of YHWH):\n    *   Considered if 'בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה' (the voice of YHWH) refers to an audible sound in the human sense or a figurative representation of divine communication.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase is a classic biblical idiom. It is a metonymy where \"voice\" (the means of communication) stands for God's divine commands, instructions, or will (the content of communication). To \"heed the voice of YHWH\" means to obey His word or law, not necessarily to perceive an audible sound. The instructions explicitly list \"פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה\" (mouth of YHWH) as an example of an idiom, and \"ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה\" functions identically as a metonymic idiom for divine communication. While God can speak audibly, in this context, it refers to the substance of His directives. Therefore, it is classified as both a metonymy and an idiom.\n\n3.  **וְעָשִׂ֙יתָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם** (and obey all the divine commandments that I enjoin upon you this day):\n    *   Considered if any part of this phrase is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: \"Obey all His commandments\" and \"I command you this day\" are straightforward, literal statements describing actions and divine instruction. No figurative language is detected in this part of the verse.\n\nTAGGING_ANALYSIS:\nFor **תָשׁוּב** (will turn back/repent):\n*   **TARGET:** The spiritual or moral state of the individual or community, specifically their change from disobedience to obedience.\n*   **VEHICLE:** The physical act of turning around, returning, or changing one's physical direction.\n*   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic is the idea of a reversal of course, a change in orientation, or a re-alignment from a wrong path to a right one. It highlights the active decision and effort required to move away from sin and back towards God.\n*   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker's posture is one of exhortation and instruction, conveying a positive expectation for the people to choose repentance and return to God, implying a path to blessing.\n\nFor **בְּק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֑ה** (the voice of YHWH):\n*   **TARGET:** God's divine commands, instructions, or revealed will, which are to be understood and obeyed.\n*   **VEHICLE:** An audible human voice, which conveys messages and authority.\n*   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic is the concept of authoritative communication and the source of divine directives. It emphasizes that God's will is communicated and demands a response of obedience, much like a human voice conveys a command.\n*   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker's posture is one of instruction and authority, emphasizing the divine origin and binding nature of the commandments. It is a neutral stance in terms of emotion, focused on conveying information and obligation.\n\n```json",

The use of these two significant, complementary parts to represent the entirety of a person's inner being and commitment is a merism.

There are no cross-domain comparisons, personification, or other figurative elements present.\n\nTAGGING_ANALYSIS:\n1.  **\"תִשְׁמַ֗ע בְּקוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה / heeding your God יהוה\"**\n    *   **TARGET:** The core subject is the act of obedience or compliance with the divine will and instructions.\n    *   **VEHICLE:** The image used is the physical act of hearing a voice, which is a common means of receiving commands or instructions.\n    *   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic is the authority inherent in God's communication and the expectation that His commands, once conveyed (even if not audibly), should be followed. It highlights the receptiveness and submission required.\n    *   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker's posture is instructional and prescriptive, emphasizing the necessity of adherence to divine law and authority.\n\n2.  **\"תָשׁוּב֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ / return to your God יהוה\"**\n    *   **TARGET:** The core subject is the spiritual act of repentance, which involves turning away from a state of disobedience or estrangement and re-establishing a right relationship with God.\n    *   **VEHICLE:** The image used is the physical act of returning to a place or person after having departed or strayed.\n    *   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic is the concept that one has deviated from God's path or presence, and that a deliberate, conscious reorientation of one's life, allegiance, and behavior is required to reconcile with Him.\n    *   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker's posture is exhortative and hopeful, emphasizing the possibility and necessity of spiritual renewal and reconciliation with God.\n\n3.  **\"בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ / with all your heart and soul\"**\n    *   **TARGET:** The core subject is the totality, sincerity, and comprehensiveness of one's devotion, commitment, and inner being in relation to God.\n    *   **VEHICLE:** The image used is the combination of the \"heart\" (representing intellect, will, and emotion) and the \"soul\" (representing life force, inner self, or vital essence), two significant parts of a human being.\n    *   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic is the principle that true obedience and repentance demand not merely outward actions, but a complete, undivided, and profound internal commitment involving every aspect of one's inner self.\n    *   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker's posture is emphatic and prescriptive, stressing the depth and all-encompassing nature of the required commitment to God.\n\n```json",

        "llm_deliberation": "FIGURATIVE_DETECTION:\nI have analyzed the provided text for potential figurative language.\n\n1.  **\"וְלֹא־מֵעֵ֥בֶר לַיָּ֖ם הִ֑וא\" (Neither is it beyond the sea):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the phrase \"מֵעֵ֥בֶר לַיָּ֖ם\" (beyond the sea) is used literally to describe a geographical location or figuratively to represent something else.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The \"it\" (הִ֑וא) refers to God's commandment or word (as per the broader context of Deuteronomy 30:11-14). A divine commandment cannot literally be located \"beyond the sea.\" Therefore, \"beyond the sea\" is not a literal geographical descriptor for the commandment. Instead, it functions as a metaphor for extreme remoteness, inaccessibility, or difficulty in obtaining or understanding. The sea, being a significant natural barrier in the ancient world, serves as a powerful image for something that is far away and hard to reach. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where the abstract concept of accessibility/difficulty is mapped onto a physical, spatial concept of distance. It is not an idiom in the sense of a fixed, non-literal phrase, but rather a descriptive phrase used metaphorically in this specific context.\n\n2.  **\"מִ֣י יַעֲבׇר־לָ֜נוּ אֶל־עֵ֤בֶר הַיָּם֙ וְיִקָּחֶ֣הָ לָּ֔נוּ וְיַשְׁמִעֵ֥נוּ אֹתָ֖הּ וְנַעֲשֶֽׂנָּה\" (Who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this rhetorical question, or any part of the actions described within it, constitutes figurative language (e.g., hyperbole, irony).\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** While this is a rhetorical question designed to emphasize the accessibility of the commandment (by implying no such arduous journey is necessary), the language used to describe the hypothetical actions (\"cross to the other side of the sea,\" \"get it for us,\" \"impart it to us,\" \"observe it\") is literal. The question itself is a rhetorical device, but it does not employ cross-domain comparisons, personification, or other forms of figurative language in its direct phrasing. Its purpose is to elaborate on the implications of the preceding metaphorical statement (\"beyond the sea\"), rather than being figurative in itself.\n\nTAGGING_ANALYSIS:\n**Figurative Instance:** \"מֵעֵ֥בֶר לַיָּ֖ם\" (beyond the sea)\n\n*   **TARGET:** The core subject being described is the **accessibility and proximity of God's commandment/word**.

It is not a metaphor for something else, nor is it an idiom in this context.\n*   **\"לָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֔יו\" / \"to walk in God’s ways\"**:\n    *   Considered: If this phrase might be a metaphor, an idiom, or both.\n    *   Reasoning for inclusion: The verb \"לָלֶכֶת\" (to walk) literally denotes physical movement. However, \"בִּדְרָכָיו\" (in His ways) refers to God's abstract moral principles, commands, and character, not a literal physical path. One cannot physically walk *in* abstract concepts. Therefore, \"walking\" is used metaphorically to describe the act of living in accordance with, following, or adhering to God's moral and ethical standards.

        "llm_deliberation": "FIGURATIVE_DETECTION:\n*   **\"your heart turns away\" (וְאִם־יִפְנֶ֥ה לְבָבְךָ֖):** I considered if this phrase might be personification (the heart acting independently), metonymy (the heart representing the inner person), or a metaphor for a change in allegiance. I concluded that it functions as a biblical idiom, encompassing both metonymic and metaphorical elements. In biblical Hebrew, \"heart\" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is a well-established metonymy for the inner self, including one's will, intellect, and moral disposition. The verb \"to turn\" (פָּנָה), when applied to the heart in this context, is a conventional metaphor for a shift in loyalty, intention, or obedience, signifying spiritual defection. Given the instruction to classify \"biblical idioms and set phrases\" as \"idiom,\" this phrase fits perfectly, as it is a common expression for spiritual disobedience. It is not the physical organ literally turning.\n*   **\"you give no heed\" (וְלֹ֣א תִשְׁמָ֑ע):** I considered if \"not hear\" could be an idiom for \"not obey.\" While \"hearing\" often implies obedience in biblical contexts, here it directly follows the \"heart turning away\" and describes the consequence of that inner defection – a refusal to listen or obey God's commands. This is a literal description of a lack of obedience, which is a direct result of the heart's turning away. It is standard narrative language describing a character's action/inaction, not a cross-domain comparison or a set phrase that requires a figurative interpretation beyond its direct meaning in this context.\n*   **\"are lured\" (וְנִדַּחְתָּ֗):** I considered if this verb, meaning \"to be driven away, led astray,\" was figurative. However, in the context of being led into idolatry, it describes a direct, albeit spiritual, action of being enticed or drawn away from the correct path. It is a literal description of the process of falling into idolatry, not a metaphor or personification.\n*   **\"worship and service of other gods\" (וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֛יתָ לֵאלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים וַעֲבַדְתָּֽם):** I considered if this could be figurative. This is a straightforward, literal description of idolatrous actions. There is no figurative language present here.\n\nTAGGING_ANALYSIS:\n*   **Figurative Instance:** \"your heart turns away\" (וְאִם־יִפְנֶ֥ה לְבָבְךָ֖)\n    *   **TARGET:** The core subject being described is the individual's inner will, loyalty, and moral disposition. It refers to the spiritual and volitional center of a person.\n    *   **VEHICLE:** The image used to convey this is a physical organ (the heart) performing a physical action (turning away). This physical action serves as a representation of an internal, non-physical change.\n    *   **GROUND:** The underlying characteristic illuminated is a change in allegiance, a shift from obedience to disobedience, or a spiritual defection. The heart, as the seat of decision and intention, is depicted as actively moving away from its proper object of devotion (God). This highlights the internal origin of apostasy and moral corruption.\n    *   **SPEAKER POSTURE:** The speaker (Moses, delivering the covenant stipulations) is warning and instructing the people, expressing a negative consequence for disobedience. The posture is one of admonition, caution, and negative anticipation regarding the potential for spiritual failure.\n\n```json",
