I carefully examined each phrase in the provided Hebrew text for potential figurative language, adhering strictly to the conservative guidelines provided.

1.  **"אַחֲרֵ֣י הַכֹּת֗וֹ" (after he had defeated/struck him):** I considered if the verb "הַכֹּת֗וֹ" (from נכה, to strike/defeat) might be a metonymy for total destruction or a euphemism for killing. However, in the context of ancient Near Eastern military narratives, "to strike" or "to defeat" is a literal and standard description of a military action. It refers directly to the physical act of combat and its outcome, not a symbolic representation. This falls under "Standard narrative language" and "Character actions," which are to be treated as literal.

2.  **"סִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י" (Sihon king of the Amorites) and "ע֚וֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֔ן" (Og king of Bashan):** These are proper nouns and titles, which are inherently literal descriptions of individuals and their roles. This falls under "Historical and genealogical information," which is to be treated as literal.

3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּחֶשְׁבּ֑וֹן" (who dwelt in Heshbon) and "אֲשֶׁר־יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּעַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּאֶדְרֶֽעִי" (who dwelt at Ashtaroth [and] Edrei):** I considered if "יוֹשֵׁ֖ב" (dwelt/resided) could be used figuratively, perhaps to imply a deeper, non-physical presence or a metaphorical "seat" of power. However, in this context, "יוֹשֵׁ֖ב" is a straightforward, literal description of the physical residence of the kings in their respective cities. Heshbon, Ashtaroth, and Edrei are geographical locations. This is standard narrative language describing "Historical and genealogical information" (specifically, geographical context for historical figures), which is to be treated as literal.

No clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons, personification of non-human entities, or obvious similes were identified. The text is a factual, historical account of military conquest and geographical locations, using standard, literal narrative language.

While one can literally carry an object or a single person, it is physically impossible for one individual to literally "carry" an entire community or nation of people. Therefore, the physical act of carrying is being used to represent a non-physical concept. This constitutes a clear metaphor. The physical act of "carrying a heavy load" (the vehicle) is employed to describe the immense responsibility, difficulty, and strain involved in leading, managing, and enduring the challenges presented by a large group of people (the tenor). The speaker (Moses) is expressing his inability to handle the administrative, judicial, and emotional demands of the people by himself. This is a common metaphorical usage across languages, where physical weight or carrying capacity is equated with responsibility or difficulty.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** While some might consider this an idiom due to its common usage, it is more accurately classified as a transparent metaphor. The connection between the physical act of carrying a heavy load and the abstract concept of bearing a heavy responsibility is readily understandable and not opaque like many fixed idioms. The English translation "bear the burden of you" explicitly highlights this metaphorical interpretation.', 'fallback_used': False}

I have carefully analyzed the provided Hebrew text and its English translation, adhering strictly to the given guidelines for identifying figurative language.

1.  **"הַהֹלֵ֣ךְ לִפְנֵיכֶ֔ם" (who goes before you)**:
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "God going before you" might be a metaphor for divine leadership or guidance.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." "God goes" is a direct anthropomorphism describing God's action. In the Ancient Near Eastern worldview, God is often depicted as literally leading, whether through a visible manifestation (like the pillar of cloud/fire) or as a divine warrior marching ahead of the army. Therefore, this is interpreted as a literal description of God's action and presence, not a figurative metaphor.

2.  **"ה֖וּא יִלָּחֵ֣ם לָכֶ֑ם" (will fight for you)**:
    *   **Considered:** I considered if "God fighting for you" might be a metaphor for divine intervention or assistance in battle.
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the previous point, "God fought" is explicitly listed as a divine anthropomorphism that is to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context. The concept of God as a divine warrior actively engaging in battle on behalf of Israel is a fundamental aspect of biblical theology. This is understood as a literal description of God's role and action, not a figurative metaphor.

3.  **"כְּ֠כֹ֠ל אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֧ה אִתְּכֶ֛ם בְּמִצְרַ֖יִם" (just as [God] did for you in Egypt)**:
    *   **Considered:** I considered if the comparison introduced by "כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר" (just as / according to all that) constitutes a simile.
    *   **Reasoning:** The guidelines state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This phrase makes a behavioral comparison, indicating that God's future actions will be consistent with God's past actions in Egypt. It is a literal statement of equivalence or similarity in behavior, not a figurative simile involving a cross-domain comparison.

4.  **"לְעֵינֵיכֶֽם" (before your very eyes)**:
    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase, often understood as an idiom for "publicly" or "openly," should be marked as figurative.
    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions mention: "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS." While "before your eyes" is a common idiom, the JSON output categories are limited to "metaphor/personification/simile." An idiom, while a type of figurative language, does not fit neatly into these specific categories unless it also functions as a metaphor, personification, or simile. In this context, "before your eyes" literally means "in your sight," emphasizing the direct observation of the events. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification of a non-human entity, or an obvious simile. Given the conservative approach and the specific JSON categories, I have chosen not to mark this as figurative in the required output format.

Based on the strict interpretation of the provided guidelines, particularly regarding divine anthropomorphisms and behavioral comparisons, I find no clear metaphors, personification, or obvious similes in this text that warrant inclusion in the JSON output.

1.  **"חָטָ֘אנוּ֮ לַיהֹוָה֒" (We stand guilty before יהוה / We have sinned against Yahweh):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "stand guilty before יהוה" might be a metaphorical expression for a state of spiritual alienation or a legalistic idiom.
    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** This is a direct and literal theological statement describing the people's acknowledgment of their transgression against God. It is not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or simile. The concept of "sinning against" or "being guilty before" God is a fundamental and literal aspect of biblical theology and human-divine relationship in the ANE context. It describes a factual spiritual and moral state, not a figurative one.

2.  **"כְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֖נוּ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ" (just as our God יהוה commanded us):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this comparison ("just as... commanded us") might be a simile.
    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This phrase falls directly under the category of a proportional or behavioral comparison, indicating that their intended action is in accordance with a divine command. Therefore, it is to be treated as literal.

3.  **"וַֽתַּחְגְּר֗וּ אִ֚ישׁ אֶת־כְּלֵ֣י מִלְחַמְתּ֔וֹ" (And [the men among] you each girded yourselves with war gear):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "girded yourselves" might be an idiom. While "girding one's loins" is an idiom for preparing for action, the specific addition of "with war gear" makes it more literal.
    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** This describes a literal physical action of preparing for battle by putting on military equipment. While "girding" can be part of an idiomatic expression for readiness, here it explicitly refers to the physical act of donning "war gear." It is a straightforward description of character action, which the guidelines state should be treated as literal.

4.  **"וַתָּהִ֖ינוּ לַעֲלֹ֥ת הָהָֽרָֽה" (and recklessly started for the hill country / and you were presumptuous to go up the mountain):**
    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the description of their action as "recklessly" or "presumptuously" might be a figurative way to describe their state of mind or the nature of their endeavor.
    *   **Reasoning for excluding:** This describes the *manner* in which they undertook a literal action (going up the mountain). It is a direct characterization of their behavior and attitude, not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or simile. It falls under standard narrative language and character actions, which are to be treated as literal.

Based on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, no clear metaphors, personification of non-human entities, or obvious similes are present in this text.

1.  **"וּבְנֵ֧י עֵשָׂ֣ו" (descendants of Esau):** I considered if "descendants of Esau" might be a form of synecdoche, where "sons" (בְנֵי) represents the entire people group. However, in biblical Hebrew, "sons of X" is a standard and literal genealogical and collective identifier for a people group or tribe. It is not a figurative cross-domain comparison or a non-literal representation in this context. Therefore, it is excluded.

2.  **"וַיַּשְׁמִידוּם֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם" (wiping them out from before them):** I considered if "מִפְּנֵיהֶם" (from before them / from their presence) might be an idiom that qualifies as figurative. While it is an idiom for "from their sight," "from their territory," or "from their presence," the guidelines state to be "conservative with... Biblical idioms and set phrases" and only mark "clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons, personification of non-human entities, [or] obvious similes." This idiom describes a literal action of removal or expulsion from a place or presence, not a figurative comparison or personification. It's a standard way to express the complete removal of a people. Therefore, it is excluded.

3.  **"כַּאֲשֶׁ֧ר עָשָׂ֣ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לְאֶ֙רֶץ֙ יְרֻשָּׁת֔וֹ" (just as Israel did in the land they were to possess):** I considered this phrase as a potential simile due to the comparative particle "כַּאֲשֶׁר" (just as). However, the guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: ... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as 'according to the blessing' or 'like all his fellow Levites'." This comparison describes a parallel between the *behavior* or *actions* of the descendants of Esau (dispossessing and settling) and the *behavior* or *actions* of Israel (dispossessing and settling). It is a literal statement of historical and behavioral equivalence, not a figurative simile that uses a vehicle from a different domain to describe a tenor. It simply states that one historical event was similar in nature to another. Therefore, it is excluded based on the specific instruction regarding behavioral comparisons.

4.  **"אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥ן יְהֹוָ֖ה לָהֶֽם" (which יהוה had given to them):** I considered "יהוה had given" as a divine anthropomorphism. The guidelines state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." The act of "giving" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a physical body part. Therefore, it is considered literal according to the guidelines and excluded from figurative language.

Based on a strict application of the provided guidelines, no figurative language is found in this text.

The act of "speaking" (וַיְדַבֵּר) is an action attributed to Yahweh, similar to the examples provided (went, was angry, watched, fought). It does not refer to a specific body part of God (e.g., "God\'s finger" or "God\'s mouth"). Therefore, according to these instructions, this anthropomorphism is to be understood as a literal divine action within the ANE narrative context. While "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of Yahweh) is listed as an idiom (and thus figurative), the simple verb "spoke" attributed to Yahweh, without explicit mention of a body part, falls under the category of literal divine actions.\n3.  **Borderline cases:** This was considered a borderline case because anthropomorphism is generally understood as a type of figurative language. However, the specific instructions for this analysis prioritize the ANE context and explicitly define which anthropomorphisms are literal and which might be figurative (only those referring to God\'s body). Since "spoke" is an action and not a reference to a body part, it adheres to the "literal" rule for divine anthropomorphisms.', 'fallback_used': False}

1.  **"כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשָׂה֙" (as [God] did):** I considered if this comparison ("as God did for X, so He did for Y") might be a simile. However, the guidelines state, "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function... Proportional or behavioral comparisons." This phrase describes a behavioral comparison (God's actions in one instance compared to another). It is a literal statement of equivalence in action or outcome, not a cross-domain comparison or an obvious simile intended to create an image. Therefore, it is excluded.

2.  **"הִשְׁמִ֤יד אֶת־הַחֹרִי֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם" (wiping out the Horites before them):**
    *   "wiping out the Horites": This is a literal description of destruction.
    *   "מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם" (before them / from before their face): I considered if this phrase, literally "from their face," might be a metonymy or a subtle personification of the Horites' presence. However, the guidelines explicitly state, "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS" and instruct to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH... Biblical idioms and set phrases." "מִפְּנֵי" is a very common Hebrew idiom meaning "from before," "in the presence of," "on account of," or "from the path of." In this context, it means God removed the Horites from the path or presence of the descendants of Esau. It functions as a standard idiomatic expression for removal or displacement, not a figurative comparison or personification. Therefore, it is excluded as a figurative element.

3.  **"וַיִּֽירָשֻׁם֙ וַיֵּשְׁב֣וּ תַחְתָּ֔ם" (so that they dispossessed them and settled in their place):** These are literal descriptions of historical actions (conquest and settlement). No figurative language is present here.

4.  **"עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה" (until this day / as is still the case):** This is a standard temporal phrase used in biblical narrative to indicate that a described situation or condition persisted up to the time of the narration. It is a literal statement of duration and historical continuity, not a metaphor, simile, or personification.

Based on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, no clear metaphors, personifications of non-human entities, or obvious similes are present in this text. The language is standard narrative, describing historical events and their consequences.

This is a very common biblical idiom (נתן ביד X, "to give into the hand of X") where a concrete physical entity (the hand, as an instrument of action and control) represents an abstract concept (power or authority).

The examples provided for idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground") are themselves figurative (metonymy, personification). This indicates that idioms, when they involve cross-domain comparisons or part-for-whole representations, should be marked as figurative. Therefore, "hand" representing "power" is a clear instance of metonymy (part for whole) or a conventionalized metaphor (physical control for abstract power).\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was initially considered borderline due to the instruction regarding idioms.

It is not a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons" where the comparison is actively felt by the audience, nor is it an "obvious simile." Instead, it falls under the category of "standard narrative language" or a "biblical idiom/set phrase" in its functional meaning, similar to how "mouth of the sword" (לְפִי־חָֽרֶב) is an idiom for the edge of the sword. The instructions explicitly state to be conservative with standard narrative language and not to mark biblical idioms as figurative. Therefore, I conclude that "חֶבֶל" in this context is a conventionalized term for a district, not a live figurative expression.\n5.  **"לְכׇל־הַבָּשָׁ֔ן" (all that part of Bashan)**: This is a literal geographical description.

The "MARK AS FIGURATIVE" section specifically lists "Clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons," "Personification of non-human entities," and "Obvious similes." The phrase "give heed to the laws" does not fit neatly into these categories as a *clear* metaphor, personification, or obvious simile. It is a metonymic idiom, but it is also extremely common and standard narrative language in biblical Hebrew. The instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Standard narrative language" and the absence of metonymy as a primary category in the "MARK AS FIGURATIVE" list (despite idioms being mentioned as a category) led me to conclude that this particular idiom, while non-literal, does not meet the threshold for explicit marking as figurative language under these specific instructions. The examples provided for idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground") are more overt instances of personification or metonymy involving body parts attributed to inanimate objects, which are arguably "clearer" forms of figurative language than the semantic extension of "listen" to "obey."', 'fallback_used': False}

These examples represent highly conventionalized phrases where the literal meaning of the individual words (e.g., "mouth," "face") is largely superseded by a fixed, non-literal meaning (e.g., "edge," "surface"). In contrast, "clinging to YHWH" still strongly evokes the *sense* of physical attachment, intimacy, and unwavering adherence, even though the action itself is spiritual. The metaphorical force remains active and contributes significantly to the meaning, rather than being a fossilized expression whose original figurative sense is lost. Therefore, it fits the criteria for "Clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons" more directly than it fits the implied definition of an idiom to be *excluded* from figurative marking.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The primary debate was between classifying it as a metaphor versus a conventionalized idiom that should not be marked as figurative per the specific instruction.

The noun קֶרֶב (qerev) literally means "inward part" or "midst," and in English, saying "in the heart of the land" would be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While קֶרֶב can refer to an internal part of a body, its use with "land" (הָאָרֶץ) is a very common and standard spatial descriptor in biblical Hebrew, meaning "within the territory" or "in the interior of the land." It functions as a conventional idiom for location, indicating presence within a geographical area. This usage is analogous to "face of the ground" (פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה), which the guidelines explicitly list as an idiom to be treated as non-figurative. It does not attribute human-like organs or qualities to the land in a way that constitutes a clear metaphor or personification according to the conservative guidelines. It is standard narrative language for spatial reference.', 'fallback_used': False}

1.  **Considered if "אֵ֤ל רַחוּם֙" (a compassionate God) might be figurative:**
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a direct descriptive attribute of God, stating a quality or characteristic. It is not a metaphor, simile, or personification, but a literal theological statement about God's nature.

2.  **Considered if "לֹ֥א יַרְפְּךָ֖" (will not fail you / will not abandon you) might be figurative:**
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The verb רפה (raphah) in Hiphil means "to let sink, abandon, fail." This is a direct statement about God's action and commitment towards the people. It describes God's steadfastness and protection, which falls under "standard narrative language" and "character actions" (divine actions in this case). It is not a cross-domain comparison or an obvious simile.

3.  **Considered if "וְלֹ֣א יַשְׁחִיתֶ֑ךָ" (nor let you perish / destroy you) might be figurative:**
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The verb שׁחת (shachat) in Hiphil means "to destroy, ruin, corrupt." This is a direct statement about God's protective action, ensuring the people's survival. It is a literal description of God's interaction and commitment, not a figurative expression.

4.  **Considered if "וְלֹ֤א יִשְׁכַּח֙ אֶת־בְּרִ֣ית אֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ" (will not forget the covenant of your fathers) might be figurative:**
    *   **What I considered:** The act of "forgetting" (שׁכח, shakaḥ) is typically a human cognitive process. Attributing this to God could be seen as an anthropomorphism.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God's body (God's finger)." "Forgetting" is a mental/cognitive action, not a reference to a physical body part. Therefore, according to the given guidelines, this anthropomorphism is to be understood literally within the ANE context, signifying God's unwavering commitment and remembrance of the covenant, rather than a figurative expression like a metaphor or personification of a non-human entity.

5.  **Considered if "אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖ע לָהֶֽם" (which [God] swore to them) might be figurative:**
    *   **What I considered:** The act of "swearing an oath" (שׁבע, shava') is a human action involving speech and commitment. Attributing this to God is an anthropomorphism.
    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** Similar to "forgetting," "swearing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a physical body part. Following the provided instructions, this divine anthropomorphism is to be interpreted literally within the ANE context, signifying God's solemn and binding commitment. It is not a figurative expression.

Based on a conservative interpretation of the text and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language is identified.

The verb כרת (karat, "to cut") refers directly to the ancient Near Eastern practice of ratifying covenants by physically cutting animals and walking between the pieces. Therefore, "cutting" is not a cross-domain comparison in the sense of a metaphor (e.g., "God is my rock"), nor is it personification (a covenant is not given human-like qualities by being "cut"), nor is it a simile. It is best understood as a **metonymic idiom** where a key physical action of the ritual (cutting) stands for the entire process of establishing the covenant. However, metonymy is not listed as a type of figurative language to be marked in the JSON output. The instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE" with biblical idioms, coupled with the specific categories for marking, leads me to conclude that this idiom, while not literal in its modern English translation, does not fit the defined criteria for metaphor, personification, or simile in this context. It describes a ritual action directly, rather than applying a concept from an unrelated domain or attributing human qualities.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was the primary borderline case due to its idiomatic nature.
