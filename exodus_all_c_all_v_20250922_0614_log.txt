The use of a patriarch\'s name for his tribe is a direct, albeit extended, reference within the established naming conventions of the ANE for groups, rather than a cross-domain comparison or a figure of speech intended to evoke an image beyond the direct referent.

While "nefesh" literally means "soul" or "breath," its use here to denote a complete human being is a well-established linguistic convention. It is not a literal "soul" being counted independently of the body, but the entire person. This is a classic instance of synecdoche (a type of metonymy) where the vital part (soul) represents the whole living being (person). Given its common and conventional usage, it also functions as a biblical idiom.\n    *   Decision: Include as metonymy and idiom.\n\n2.  **"יֹצְאֵ֥י יֶֽרֶךְ־יַעֲקֹ֖ב" (yotz\'ei yerekh-ya\'akov) - "those who came out of Jacob\'s thigh/loins"**:\n    *   Considered: Whether "yerekh" (thigh/loins) used to refer to "offspring" or "descendants" is a metonymy and/or an idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase "yotz\'ei yerekh" (those who came out of the thigh/loins) is a common biblical idiom for biological descendants or issue (e.g., Gen 46:26; Exod 1:5; Judg 8:30). The "thigh" or "loins" (yerekh) is understood as the anatomical source of procreation. It is not a literal "thigh" that gives birth, but the part of the body associated with the generative process. Therefore, using "thigh/loins" to represent "offspring" or "lineage" is a clear example of metonymy (specifically synecdoche, where a part of the body represents the source of the whole lineage) and a well-established biblical idiom.\n    *   Decision: Include as metonymy and idiom.\n\n3.  **"שִׁבְעִ֣ים נָ֑פֶשׁ" (shiv\'im nafesh) - "seventy persons" (lit.

This verb literally means "to be fruitful, bear fruit," and is commonly used for both plants and animals, and in Genesis, specifically for human procreation (e.g., Gen 1:28, 9:1, 35:11). In this context, it describes the biological capacity and act of reproduction. This is a literal description of their increase.\n\n2.  **"וַֽיִּשְׁרְצ֛וּ" (and prolific/swarmed):** I considered if this verb (שרץ) is figurative. The verb שרץ (sharatz) literally means "to teem, swarm, multiply abundantly." Its primary domain of use in the Hebrew Bible is for non-human life forms, particularly fish, birds, insects, and small creeping animals (e.g., Gen 1:20, 7:21, Ex 8:3, 8:17). When applied to humans, as it is here, it creates a vivid cross-domain comparison, likening the Israelites\' rapid and numerous reproduction to the teeming abundance of lower life forms. This is not merely "multiplying" but multiplying *like* swarming creatures, conveying an overwhelming and perhaps almost uncontrollable proliferation. This constitutes a **metaphor** due to the cross-domain comparison and also functions as **hyperbole** by exaggerating the extent and nature of their increase beyond simple multiplication.\n\n3.  **"וַיִּרְבּ֥וּ" (and multiplied):** I considered if "multiplied" (רבה) is figurative. This verb literally means "to become many, increase." It is a standard, literal description of population growth.\n\n4.  **"וַיַּֽעַצְמ֖וּ בִּמְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד" (and increased very greatly/became mighty very, very much):** I considered if "increased very greatly" (עצם במאד מאד) is figurative. The verb עצם means "to be strong, mighty, numerous." The intensifier "בִּמְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד" (very, very much) emphasizes the degree of their increase. While it describes a significant and perhaps astonishing growth, it is a literal description of their numerical and perhaps even physical strength, not a cross-domain comparison or an impossible exaggeration. It falls within the bounds of strong narrative description rather than hyperbole.\n\n5.  **"וַתִּמָּלֵ֥א הָאָ֖רֶץ אֹתָֽם" (so that the land was filled with them):** I considered if "the land was filled with them" is figurative. This phrase describes the high population density of the Israelites. While it indicates a very large number, it is a common and literal way to express that a region became densely populated. It does not imply personification of the land, nor does it present an impossible or absurd scenario that would qualify as hyperbole. It is a direct statement about the spatial occupation by the population.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only the verb "וַֽיִּשְׁרְצ֛וּ" (and prolific/swarmed) is identified as genuinely figurative, functioning as both a metaphor and hyperbole.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in biblical narrative, "not knowing" (ידע) in such a context often extends beyond mere factual ignorance. It implies a deliberate non-recognition, a disregard for Joseph\'s past contributions, his established status, or the covenant relationship he represented, and by extension, a disavowal of the favorable position of the Israelites. This phrase signals a significant shift in policy and attitude towards the Israelites, indicating a deliberate choice to ignore or overturn Joseph\'s legacy.

However, the Hebrew terms "רַב" (numerous, great) and "עָצוּם" (mighty, strong) are direct, literal adjectives describing the perceived quantity and potential power of the Israelite population relative to the Egyptians. Pharaoh\'s statement reflects his genuine concern and assessment of their demographic and strategic threat. It is presented as a factual observation from his perspective, not an exaggeration for rhetorical effect. The comparison "מִמֶּֽנּוּ" (than us) is also a literal comparative statement.

However, this phrase directly describes a strategic and intelligent approach to a situation. It is a literal statement about the manner of their intended action, not a comparison to something else. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"פֶּן־יִרְבֶּ֗ה" (pen-yirbeh) - "so that they may not increase"**: I considered if "increase" (referring to population growth) could be figurative.

While "war calls" could, in some contexts, be personification, in biblical Hebrew, the verb קרא (qara\') can literally mean "to happen" or "to befall" (e.g., "lest disaster befall him" in Gen 42:4). Therefore, "when war happens" or "when war is encountered" is a literal and common way to express the occurrence of war. It does not attribute human-like agency to war in a vivid, metaphorical sense.

I considered both a literal physical rising and a figurative interpretation. A literal physical rising from the ground (e.g., from being buried or hiding) is highly improbable and contextually nonsensical in the scenario of joining enemies and fighting. The accompanying footnote explicitly supports a figurative reading: "Meaning perhaps from their wretched condition... or \'gain ascendancy over the country.\'" This indicates a clear cross-domain comparison. The "ground" (or "land") serves as a vehicle representing a state of low status, subjugation, or lack of power, and "rising from it" is the vehicle for gaining power, ascendancy, or improving their social/political condition.

In the context of population growth, this verb applies the imagery of a forceful, rapid, and perhaps uncontrollable physical breaking or bursting (e.g., a dam breaking, water bursting forth) to the domain of human population expansion. This is a clear cross-domain comparison, emphasizing the overwhelming and vigorous nature of their increase. It\'s not merely "spreading," but "bursting forth" in growth. Therefore, it functions as a metaphor. It is not hyperbole, as it describes the *manner* of growth rather than an exaggeration of its quantity.\n\n4.  **וַיָּקֻ֕צוּ** (so that the [Egyptians] came to dread):\n    *   Considered if "dreaded" might be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal description of an emotional state experienced by the Egyptians.

The "face" (פָּנִים) does not refer to a literal facial expression causing dread, but rather the presence, influence, or sheer number of the Israelites. This is a standard idiomatic expression in Hebrew, and as per the instructions, it is classified as an "idiom."\n\n**Borderline cases debated:**\n*   The verb "יִפְרֹץ" (yifrots): The line between a vivid literal description and a metaphor can be subtle. I debated if "spread out" was simply a literal description of population distribution. However, considering the stronger meaning of "break forth" or "burst out" inherent in פָּרַרַץ, and its use in other contexts (e.g., 2 Sam 5:20 "like a breakthrough of waters"), I concluded that applying this verb to population growth constitutes a metaphor. It describes the *quality* of their increase with an image of forceful, expansive breaking.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Here, it is applied to "life" (חַיֵּיהֶם), an abstract concept that cannot literally have a taste. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison where the sensory quality of "bitterness" is used to describe the severe hardship, suffering, and unpleasantness of their existence.

When applied to "labor" (עֲבֹדָה), it directly describes the quality and nature of the work itself – its difficulty, severity, and oppressiveness. This is a literal description of the labor\'s characteristics, not a comparison to something else.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **בְּחֹ֙מֶר֙ וּבִלְבֵנִ֔ים** (bəḥomer uvilvenim) - "at mortar and bricks"\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "mortar and bricks" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are literal materials used in the labor described.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וּבְכׇל־עֲבֹדָ֖ה בַּשָּׂדֶ֑ה** (uvəḵol-ʿavodah baśśadeh) - "and with all sorts of tasks in the field"\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "tasks in the field" is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase literally describes types of labor and their location.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **בְּפָֽרֶךְ** (bəfareḵ) - "ruthlessly" (or "with crushing severity")\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "בְּפָֽרֶךְ" is figurative, especially given the English translation "crushing severity."\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Hebrew term פָּרֶךְ (parekh) denotes severity, rigor, or cruelty, particularly in the context of forced labor. It describes the *manner* in which the labor was imposed—with harshness and oppression. While the English "crushing" might evoke a metaphorical image, the Hebrew term itself functions as a direct, strong descriptor of the quality of the imposition, not a cross-domain comparison.

This phrase is a literal statement of difference in behavior/physical characteristic (how they give birth) between two groups of women, not a figurative simile. It describes a factual distinction regarding their birthing process.\n\n3.  **"כִּֽי־חָי֣וֹת הֵ֔נָּה" (they are vigorous / lit. they are animals)**:\n    *   Considered: If this is a metaphor, simile, or idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: The Hebrew "חָי֣וֹת הֵ֔נָּה" (ḥayyot hennah) literally translates to "animals they are" or "living creatures they are." The absence of the comparative particle כְּ (kə-, "like") indicates a direct identification rather than a comparison using "like" or "as." Therefore, it functions as a metaphor, directly equating the Hebrew women with animals (specifically, wild animals known for their natural, quick, and unassisted birthing process). The English translation "vigorous" captures the *ground* of the metaphor (the quality being emphasized) but obscures the *vehicle* (the animal comparison). This is a clear cross-domain comparison, identifying human women with non-human animals.\n\n4.  **"בְּטֶ֨רֶם תָּב֧וֹא אֲלֵהֶ֛ן הַמְיַלֶּ֖דֶת וְיָלָֽדוּ" (Before the midwife can come to them, they have given birth)**:\n    *   Considered: If this statement is hyperbole.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase describes the extreme speed and self-sufficiency of the Hebrew women in childbirth. While it might be literally true in some individual cases, the statement is presented as a general characteristic applicable to the Hebrew women as a group. It is highly improbable that *every single* Hebrew woman gives birth *before* a midwife can arrive. Therefore, this is an exaggeration used to emphasize their remarkable vigor and quickness, serving to justify the midwives\' inability to intervene. This fits the definition of hyperbole.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It encompasses religious devotion and moral conduct. The instructions specify that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."

The English translation\'s note, "Meaning of Heb. batim uncertain," and its choice of "households" (which can imply family units or prosperity, not just buildings) strongly suggest a non-literal interpretation. When God "makes houses" for individuals who fear Him, it is commonly understood as establishing their families, granting them descendants, ensuring their prosperity, or securing their social standing. This is a metonymy where the physical dwelling (house) stands for the social unit (family/household) or the prosperity and continuity associated with it. If it were merely literal construction, it would be a divine anthropomorphism of action, which the instructions state to treat literally. However, the common biblical usage of "house" in this context points to a deeper, figurative meaning of establishing a family or lineage.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** A literal interpretation (God built physical houses) is grammatically possible, but the idiomatic use of "house" for "family/lineage" in contexts of divine blessing makes the metonymic interpretation more probable and richer in meaning.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a metonymy.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 1, 'truncation_occurred': 'yes'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It is not a metaphorical way of saying "kill them" in general, but rather specifies the exact method of execution.

However, in this context, it describes a literal physical movement of the man. This is standard narrative language for a character\'s action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **מִבֵּ֣ית לֵוִ֑י** (from the house of Levi): I considered if "house" (בַּיִת) refers to a literal physical dwelling or is a figurative representation of a family, clan, or lineage. In biblical Hebrew, "house of X" (בֵּית X) is a very common and well-established idiom (specifically, a type of metonymy/synecdoche) used to refer to the descendants, family, or tribe of a person or group, rather than a physical building. This is a standard set phrase in the biblical narrative. Given the instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, I have marked this as figurative.\n\n3.  **וַיִּקַּ֖ח** (and took): I considered if "took" (לָקַח) in the context of "taking a woman" (לקח אשה) is a literal physical taking or an idiomatic expression for marriage. The phrase "לקח אשה" is the standard biblical Hebrew idiom for entering into a marital covenant and bringing a wife into one\'s household. It does not imply a literal abduction or simple physical acquisition in the modern sense, but the formal act of marriage. The English translation\'s clarification "[into his household as his wife]" supports this idiomatic understanding. Therefore, I have marked this as figurative.\n\n4.  **אֶת־בַּת־לֵוִֽי** (a woman of Levi / daughter of Levi): I considered if "daughter of Levi" (בַּת־לֵוִֽי) is a literal daughter of Levi (the patriarch) or a figurative way to denote tribal affiliation. In genealogical and tribal contexts, "daughter of X" is a literal descriptor meaning "a female descendant or member of the tribe/family of X." It is a direct statement of origin and affiliation, not a figurative comparison, personification, or an idiom with a non-literal meaning. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n---\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, "hide him no longer" is a literal statement describing the physical and practical inability to continue concealing the child. It refers directly to the cessation of a physical action (hiding) due to the child\'s growth or the increasing danger, rather than a cross-domain comparison or a fixed idiomatic expression. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n*   **וַתִּֽקַּֽח־לוֹ֙ תֵּ֣בַת גֹּ֔מֶא** ("she got a wicker basket for him"): I considered if "wicker basket" could be symbolic or a metaphor for a vessel of salvation.

However, the verb `תֵּתַצַּב` (from נצב) literally means "to stand, to take one\'s stand, to station oneself." It describes a direct physical action of positioning oneself.

However, `מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂה לֽוֹ` is a direct and literal question: "what will be done to him?" The verb `יֵעָשֶׂה` (from עשׂה) is a passive form meaning "it will be done/made."

I debated whether this constitutes personification or an idiom. While "יַד" (yad) literally means "hand," it is a very common idiom in Biblical Hebrew to refer to the "side," "bank," or "border" of a geographical feature (e.g., "hand of the sea" for "seashore," "hand of the desert" for "edge of the desert"). In this context, it functions as a fixed geographical idiom meaning "alongside the Nile" or "by the bank of the Nile." It does not actively attribute human qualities or actions to the Nile beyond using a body part to denote a spatial boundary, which is characteristic of an idiom rather than a vivid personification.

There is no figurative meaning; it describes a straightforward biological and caregiving act.\n\n4.  **וַאֲנִ֖י אֶתֵּ֣ן אֶת־שְׂכָרֵ֑ךְ** (and I will pay your wages): I considered if "pay your wages" (אֶתֵּ֣ן אֶת־שְׂכָרֵ֑ךְ) could be an idiom. However, it describes a literal financial transaction for services rendered. While "wages" (שָׂכָר) can sometimes be used in a broader sense (e.g., reward), here it refers specifically to payment for the act of nursing.

However, in the ancient Near Eastern context, adoption was a legal and social reality that literally established a parent-child relationship. The child *literally* became her son in a legal and social sense, even if not biologically. This is a statement of a change in status and relationship, not a figurative comparison.

It directly describes a physical action of turning or looking in multiple directions. It does not convey a meaning beyond its literal components, unlike the examples of figurative idioms provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword"). It is a direct description of Moses\'s physical movement and observation, not a figurative expression. Therefore, it is not an idiom, metaphor, or metonymy.\n\n2.  **וַיַּ֖רְא כִּ֣י אֵ֣ין אִ֑ישׁ** (and, seeing no one about)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "seeing no one about" could be interpreted as a figurative expression for a lack of witnesses or a sense of isolation.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase is a straightforward, literal description of Moses\'s perception. "Seeing" (וַיַּרְא) refers to the physical act of observation, and "no one" (אֵין אִישׁ) is a literal statement of absence. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or non-literal meaning implied.

In this context, it describes a direct, violent physical action resulting in death. It is a literal description of the event, consistent with standard narrative language for character actions.

It is a factual account of Moses\'s action.\n\n**Conclusion:** After analyzing each phrase, I find no instances of clear metaphors, personification, obvious similes, or figurative idioms as defined by the guidelines.

It does not carry a non-literal meaning. "Two Hebrews" (שְׁנֵֽי־אֲנָשִׁ֥ים עִבְרִ֖ים) is a literal description of the individuals.

The speaker is literally questioning Moses\' legitimate appointment to a specific, recognized role of authority within their community. The instruction explicitly states: "Never mark as figurative: Comparisons of role or function... These are literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function, not figurative similes." This phrase is a direct challenge to Moses\' perceived or assumed role, not a figurative comparison.\n\n2.  **"הַלְהׇרְגֵ֙נִי֙ אַתָּ֣ה אֹמֵ֔ר כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הָרַ֖גְתָּ אֶת־הַמִּצְרִ֑י" / "Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?"**\n    *   Considered: I considered if the comparison "as you killed the Egyptian" (כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הָרַ֖גְתָּ אֶת־הַמִּצְרִ֑י) constitutes a figurative simile.\n    *   Reasoning: This is not a figurative simile.

"The matter" (הַדָּבָֽר) refers directly to the specific event of Moses killing the Egyptian, and "is known" (נוֹדַ֥ע) literally means that the information has become public.

While literally referring to "face," the phrase "מִפְּנֵי" (mippəne) is used idiomatically to mean "from the presence of," "from before," or simply "from" a person or entity. Moses did not literally flee from Pharaoh\'s physical face, but from his presence, authority, or pursuit. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom and also functions as a metonymy where the "face" represents the person\'s presence or authority.\n\n4.  **וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב בְּאֶֽרֶץ־מִדְיָ֖ן** (He arrived/settled in the land of Midian):\n    *   Considered if **וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב** (vayyeshev, lit. "and he sat") meaning "settled" or "dwelled" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: The Hebrew verb יָשַׁב (yashav) has a broad semantic range, encompassing "to sit," "to dwell," "to reside," and "to settle." In this context, "settled in the land of Midian" is a direct and common meaning of the verb, not a metaphorical usage that implies a cross-domain comparison or a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning.

There is no indication that either term is used to represent something other than its direct meaning. This is standard narrative language describing a character\'s identity. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"שֶׁ֣בַע בָּנ֑וֹת" (had seven daughters)**\n    *   **Considered:** If the number "seven" carries symbolic meaning beyond its literal count, or if "daughters" could be a metaphorical term.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "seven" is a literal numerical quantity of the daughters. While "seven" can have symbolic significance in other biblical texts (e.g., completeness), here it functions purely as a factual count. "Daughters" (בָּנוֹת) literally refers to female offspring. This is straightforward genealogical information. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"וַתָּבֹ֣אנָה וַתִּדְלֶ֗נָה וַתְּמַלֶּ֙אנָה֙ אֶת־הָ֣רְהָטִ֔ים" (They came to draw water, and filled the troughs)**\n    *   **Considered:** If the actions ("came," "drew," "filled") or the object ("troughs") could be metaphorical, personified, or part of an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are all literal descriptions of physical actions performed by the daughters (coming to a well, drawing water, filling containers) and a literal object (troughs, רְהָטִים). There are no cross-domain comparisons, inanimate objects acting like humans, or established idiomatic expressions. This is standard narrative describing character actions.

Specifically, if "flock" could be a metaphor for people (as in a spiritual leader\'s followers).\n    *   **Reasoning:** "To water" is a literal action of providing liquid to animals. "Flock" (צֹאן) in Hebrew literally refers to sheep or goats. In this pastoral context, it is the standard, literal collective noun for the animals being tended. There is no indication that "flock" here refers to people or any other entity beyond the literal animals. This is standard narrative describing the purpose of their actions. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n**Borderline cases debated:** None.

However, this is a literal description of an action taken by the shepherds to remove the women and their flocks from the well. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **וַיָּ֤קׇם מֹשֶׁה֙** (Moses rose): I considered if "Moses rose" (וַיָּקׇם מֹשֶׁה) could be an idiom for "taking action" or "standing up for" someone, similar to the English idiom "rose to their defense." While the English translation uses an idiom, the Hebrew phrase וַיָּקׇם is a very common narrative construction (Qal imperfect consecutive of קוּם) that can mean "he stood up," "he arose," or "he got up." It often precedes another verb, indicating the initiation of an action. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and the examples of idioms provided (which involve clear cross-domain comparisons like "mouth of the sword" or "face of the ground"), this phrase does not meet the criteria for a figurative idiom, metaphor, or personification. It describes a literal or semi-literal physical action that initiates Moses\' subsequent intervention.\n\n4.  **וַיּ֣וֹשִׁעָ֔ן** (and saved them / to their defense): I considered if "saved them" might be a hyperbole or metaphor. However, this is a literal description of Moses\' action to rescue the women from the shepherds.

However, in this narrative context, it describes a straightforward physical action of coming back to a location. This is literal.\n2.  **"to their father Reuel" (אֶל־רְעוּאֵ֖ל אֲבִיהֶ֑ן):** I considered if "father" could be used metaphorically (e.g., a spiritual father or a leader). However, the context clearly indicates a literal familial relationship. This is literal.\n3.  **"he said" (וַיֹּ֕אמֶר):** This is a standard narrative device for introducing direct speech. It is a literal description of the act of speaking.\n4.  **"How is it that you have come back so soon today?"

The act of coming back is literal.\n    *   **"so soon" (מִהַרְתֶּ֥ן בֹּ֖א - literally "you hastened to come"):** I considered if "so soon" might be hyperbole, an idiom, or a simile.\n        *   **Hyperbole:** While Reuel expresses surprise at their quick return, the phrase "so soon" or "you hastened" is a direct description of the speed of their action relative to an implicit expectation. It does not necessarily involve an exaggeration beyond what is literally possible or observed. It\'s a statement of fact from his perspective. For example, if they were expected to be gone for a long time and returned quickly, "so soon" accurately describes the timing. It doesn\'t cross into an exaggerated, impossible, or clearly non-literal description.\n        *   **Idiom:** This phrase is not a recognized biblical idiom. It\'s a straightforward combination of a verb meaning "to hasten" and "to come."\n        *   **Simile/Metaphor:** There is no cross-domain comparison (e.g., "you came back like a flash of lightning") or implicit comparison to another entity.\n        *   **Proportional or Behavioral Comparison:** The guidelines state to "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE" proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'. The phrase "so soon" or "you hastened to come" falls under a behavioral comparison (the speed of their action) or a proportional comparison (the amount of time taken versus expected).

The daughters were not literally being held by the shepherds\' hands but were being oppressed or prevented from accessing the well by their power. This is a very common biblical idiom.

Bread was the staple food and often represented a meal or sustenance in general. In the context of inviting a stranger into one\'s home, "to eat bread" signifies offering hospitality and a full meal, not merely a piece of bread. It is a synecdoche where a prominent part (bread) stands for the whole (a meal, sustenance, or the act of hospitality). This is a common biblical idiom for sharing a meal and extending hospitality.\n    *   Borderline cases: One might argue it\'s simply a literal instruction to give him bread. However, the broader cultural context of hospitality in the Ancient Near East, where offering "bread" to a guest implied a full meal and shelter, strongly supports its interpretation as an idiom/metonymy for hospitality. The father is not just asking them to give him a single piece of bread, but to invite him in for sustenance and care.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Attributing the physical action of "rising" (וַתַּ֧עַל) to this abstract entity constitutes personification. Furthermore, this ascent "to God" (אֶל־הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים) functions as a metaphor for the cry being heard, acknowledged, and received by God, implying divine attention and potential intervention.

This phrase is also a very common and established biblical idiom for prayer being heard by God.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** While such expressions are conventional in biblical language for prayer, their underlying structure involves attributing physical actions to abstract concepts and using spatial imagery to describe divine reception.

However, in this specific narrative, Moses is literally engaged in the physical act of caring for sheep. There is no contextual cue to suggest a deeper, figurative meaning at this point in the story. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n2.  **"drove the flock into the wilderness" (וַיִּנְהַ֤ג אֶת־הַצֹּאן֙ אַחַ֣ר הַמִּדְבָּ֔ר)**: This is a straightforward, literal description of Moses\'s action.

It is not a direct metaphor where the mountain *is* God, nor is it personification. While one could argue for metonymy (God standing for divine presence), the most fitting classification, according to the provided guidelines, is an idiom or set phrase. The Hebrew construction "X of God" (X הָאֱלֹהִים or X אֵל) is a common biblical idiom used to express superlative quality, divine origin, or sacredness (e.g., "cedars of God" for mighty cedars, "city of God" for a sacred city). In this context, "mountain of God" signifies a mountain of profound divine significance, a sacred place where God\'s presence is particularly manifest or where divine events are destined to occur. It conveys a qualitative aspect of the mountain beyond mere ownership. Given the instruction to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type, this phrase fits perfectly.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It does not imply that the bush itself possessed the faculty of speech or was speaking. Rather, the bush serves as the physical locus from which God\'s voice emanates.

While "hineni" is an idiom (a fixed expression), its meaning ("Here I am" or "Behold me") is quite literal and direct. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or metonymy in the way the examples provided for figurative idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "mouth of Yahweh," "face of the ground") do. Given the conservative nature of the instructions and the distinction between general idioms and *figurative* idioms, this phrase is considered a literal statement conveyed through a fixed expression, rather than a figurative one.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Not figurative.\n\nBased on the analysis, no figurative language is present in this verse according to the provided guidelines.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the instructions specify that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. "Saying" is an action, not a body part, and represents divine communication directly. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **רָאֹ֥ה רָאִ֛יתִי אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖י** (I have marked well the plight of My people / I have surely seen the affliction of My people):\n    *   **רָאֹ֥ה רָאִ֛יתִי** (I have surely seen): This is an infinitive absolute construction used for emphatic assertion ("seeing, I have seen"). It is a grammatical device for emphasis, not a figurative expression.\n    *   **אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖י** (the plight of My people): I considered if "plight" or "affliction" could be a metaphor. However, it is a direct and literal description of the suffering condition of the people.\n    *   **רָאִ֛יתִי** (I have seen): I considered if God "seeing" is a figurative anthropomorphism. Following the instructions, "seeing" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a body part (like "God\'s finger"). In the ANE context, such divine actions are to be treated as literal expressions of divine perception and awareness. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **וְאֶת־צַעֲקָתָ֤ם שָׁמַ֙עְתִּי֙** (and have heeded their outcry / and I have heard their cry):\n    *   **צַעֲקָתָ֤ם** (their outcry): I considered if "outcry" could be a metaphor for a general state of distress.

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **מִפְּנֵ֣י נֹֽגְשָׂ֔יו** (because of their taskmasters / from the face of their taskmasters): I considered the phrase **מִפְּנֵ֣י** (from the face of / because of). The literal meaning of פְּנֵי is "face." In this context, "from the face of their taskmasters" is not meant literally as coming from the physical face, but rather "because of" or "due to the presence/actions of" their taskmasters. This is a well-established biblical idiom where "face" (פְּנֵי) functions metonymically to represent presence, cause, or agency. The instructions explicitly state that biblical idioms and set phrases, such as those involving "פְּנֵי," should be classified as "idiom." Therefore, this phrase is marked as figurative (idiom and metonymy).\n\n5.  **כִּ֥י יָדַ֖עְתִּי אֶת־מַכְאֹבָֽיו** (yes, I am mindful of their sufferings / for I know their pains):\n    *   **יָדַ֖עְתִּי** (I am mindful/know): I considered if God "knowing" is a figurative anthropomorphism.

"Come down" refers to God\'s action or presence, not a specific body part, and is understood literally within the ANE worldview regarding divine activity. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"מִיַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם" (from the hand of Egypt):** I considered this phrase for metonymy or idiom. The Hebrew word יָד (yad, "hand") is frequently used in biblical Hebrew to represent power, authority, or control, rather than a literal physical hand of a nation. This is a classic example of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part represents the whole or an attribute represents the entity) and is also a well-established biblical idiom.

Therefore, I have included it as figurative, specifically as an idiom and metonymy.\n\n3.  **"אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָ֑שׁ" (a land flowing with milk and honey):** I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor, idiom, and hyperbole. This is a highly conventional and frequently used description of the Promised Land in the Bible. While milk and honey are real substances, the land is not literally a river of these liquids. Instead, the "flowing" (זָבַת) aspect, combined with "milk and honey," serves as a vivid and exaggerated description of the land\'s extraordinary fertility, abundance, and desirability. It is a clear cross-domain comparison (land\'s richness likened to flowing, sweet, and nourishing substances). It functions as a metaphor, an idiom due to its fixed and conventional usage, and hyperbole due to the exaggeration of the land\'s natural bounty. Therefore, I have included it as figurative, classifying it as an idiom, metaphor, and hyperbole.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"צַעֲקַ֥ת בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל" (the cry of the Israelites):** This refers to the actual vocal expressions of distress and suffering from the Israelites. I considered if "cry" could be metonymy for their suffering, but the cry itself is the subject of the verb "has reached," making it a literal sound. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"בָּ֣אָה אֵלָ֑י" (has reached Me / has come to Me):** This phrase, in conjunction with "the cry," was the primary focus for figurative language.\n    *   I considered if it was **personification**, attributing the human-like ability to "come" to an inanimate sound (the cry). While a sound doesn\'t literally walk or fly, the phrase is a conventional expression.\n    *   I considered if it was a **metaphor**, where the cry is implicitly compared to a messenger or a physical object that travels.\n    *   Ultimately, I determined it is best classified as an **idiom**. The phrase "a cry coming to X" (צעקה באה אל X) is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew. It signifies that a complaint, plea, or distress has been heard, acknowledged, and taken notice of by the recipient (often a divine or authoritative figure). The "coming" is not a literal physical movement of the sound wave itself, but rather the conventional way of expressing that the information or plea conveyed by the cry has been registered and is being attended to. The guidelines explicitly state to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type. This fits the definition of a set phrase with a conventional, non-literal meaning in this context.\n\n4.  **"וְגַם־רָאִ֙יתִי֙" (moreover, I have seen):** This refers to God\'s perception and awareness. I considered if this was figurative due to being a divine anthropomorphism. However, the guidelines explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "I have seen" (רָאִיתִי) falls under the category of God\'s perception/watching and does not refer to a specific body part like "God\'s finger," it is to be considered literal according to the instructions, signifying God\'s direct awareness and knowledge. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"אֶת־הַלַּ֔חַץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִצְרַ֖יִם לֹחֲצִ֥ים אֹתָֽם" (the oppression how the Egyptians oppress them):** This is a literal description of the situation and the actions of the Egyptians.

I ruled it out as an idiom because it is not a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning comparable to the examples provided (e.g., "face of the sword"). It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, so it is not a metaphor or simile. It does not personify a non-human entity. While the rhetorical question functions to express Moses\'s perceived inadequacy or unworthiness for the task (a form of understatement), "understatement" is not an allowed category for figurative language in the instructions (which specify simile, metaphor, personification, idiom, hyperbole, metonymy, other). Given the conservative nature of the instructions and the emphasis on "clear metaphors," "obvious similes," and specific idioms, a rhetorical question, even with its implied meaning, is considered a literal question in its form, and its rhetorical function does not fit the specified figurative categories.

However, "being with" is a literal statement of presence. While it implies support and assistance in this context, it does not involve a cross-domain comparison or an imaginative likeness. It is a direct promise of companionship and aid. Therefore, it is considered literal.\n3.  **וְזֶה־לְּךָ֣ הָא֔וֹת (that shall be your sign):** I considered if "sign" (אוֹת) might be used metaphorically.

It is not a symbolic representation of something else, but a direct indicator.

While the question "What is his name?" certainly *implies* a desire to understand God\'s nature and power, the word "name" itself is used literally to refer to the appellation by which God is known. The question is a direct inquiry about the name, which in its cultural context, inherently carries implications of identity and character.

It is a direct statement of God\'s being or identity, albeit a profound and somewhat enigmatic one. It defines God\'s nature rather than likening it to another domain.\n    *   **Metonymy/Synecdoche:** It does not use a related concept or a part to represent the whole.

It functions as a proper name or a descriptive title that encapsulates God\'s active, dynamic presence and self-existence. The uncertainty in translation noted in the English text highlights its theological depth and mystery, but not its linguistic function as a figure of speech like a metaphor or idiom. It is a direct statement of *who* God is, even if that "who" is complex and profound.

Therefore, it is marked as metonymy.\n\n7.  **לְדֹ֥ר דֹּֽר** (for all eternity / for generation to generation): I considered this phrase as a potential idiom.

The construction "infinitive absolute + finite verb" (פָּקֹ֤ד פָּקַ֙דְתִּי֙) is a common grammatical idiom in Hebrew used for emphasis, certainty, or intensity.

It means to cause someone to be regarded favorably or to find grace in the sight of another. It does not involve a literal physical act of giving an object called "favor," nor is it a clear cross-domain comparison (metaphor) or a part-for-whole substitution (metonymy) beyond the conventionalized usage of the verb "give" in this context. It is a fixed expression conveying the imparting of goodwill.

"In the eyes of X" (בעיני X) is consistently used to mean "in the opinion of X," "in the sight of X," or "to X," referring to the perception or judgment of a person or group, rather than their literal physical eyes. The "eyes" (a part of the body) stand for the faculty of perception or the collective judgment of the Egyptians (the whole). This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche) that functions as a fixed idiom in biblical Hebrew.\n\n3.  **"לֹ֥א תֵלְכ֖וּ רֵיקָֽם" (you will not go away empty-handed):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this is a literal statement, a metaphor, or an idiom/metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a common biblical idiom. "To go away empty-handed" (הלך ריקם) means to depart without possessions, wealth, or reward. It does not literally imply that the Israelites\' physical hands will be empty, but rather that they will not be destitute or unrewarded materially. The state of one\'s hands (empty) metonymically represents their material status or lack thereof. This is a metonymy that has become a fixed idiom in biblical Hebrew.\n\n**Borderline cases:** None. Both identified instances are clear and well-established idioms that also involve metonymy.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in the context of the narrative, this is presented as a direct instruction for a literal action. The women are literally to ask for items from their neighbors. While the intent is not to return them, the act described is "borrowing" or "asking." This is standard narrative language describing a character action.

However, this is a literal instruction to adorn their children with the acquired items. This is standard narrative language describing a character action. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n4.  **"thus stripping the Egyptians" (וְנִצַּלְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־מִצְרָֽיִם)**: This phrase was the primary focus of my deliberation.\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the verb נצל (niṣṣal) in the Hif\'il stem, translated here as "stripping," should be taken literally or figuratively. The verb can mean "to deliver/rescue" or "to strip/plunder." In this context, with "Egyptians" as the direct object and referring to the taking of their possessions, the meaning "to plunder" or "to strip" is clearly intended.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: The Israelites are not literally physically stripping the clothes off the Egyptians\' bodies. Instead, they are taking their valuable possessions (silver, gold, clothing). The act of taking a nation\'s wealth and resources is described using the imagery of "stripping." This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison: the physical act of stripping a person (e.g., of clothes) is applied to the economic act of depriving a nation of its wealth. This is a metaphor, as the Egyptians (as a collective representing their wealth) are being treated *as if* they are being physically stripped bare. The purpose is to emphasize the completeness and severity of the economic deprivation inflicted upon the Egyptians.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: I debated if this could be considered a literal meaning of "plunder" and thus not figurative. However, the English translation "stripping" highlights the metaphorical nuance inherent in the Hebrew verb\'s usage in this context. Even if "plunder" is a literal action, the *image* of "stripping" implies a more complete and forceful removal, drawing on the physical domain to describe an economic reality. This fits the criteria for a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons." I also considered metonymy (where the effect of loss of wealth is represented by the action of stripping), but metaphor seems more fitting as it describes *how* the Egyptians are affected, likened to being stripped.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n2.  **וְהֵן֙ לֹֽא־יַאֲמִינוּ לִ֔י** (What if they do not believe me): I considered if "believe me" could be figurative.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n3.  **וְלֹ֥א יִשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּקֹלִ֑י** (and do not listen to me / literally "in my voice"): I considered if "listen to my voice" (יִשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּקֹלִ֑י) is an idiom. While "to hear in the voice" has a literal auditory component, in biblical Hebrew, the phrase "שמע בקול" (shama\' b\'qol) consistently functions as an idiom meaning "to obey," "to heed," or "to comply with the words/command of" someone, rather than merely perceiving the sound of their voice. The context of "not believing me" reinforces this interpretation, indicating a lack of acceptance and obedience to the message Moses conveys. This is a common biblical idiom where the literal components combine to form a conventional, non-literal meaning of compliance or heeding. I classify this as an idiom.\n4.  **כִּ֣י יֹֽאמְר֔וּ לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖יךָ יְהֹוָֽה** (but say: יהוה did not appear to you?): I considered if "יהוה did not appear to you" (לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖יךָ יְהֹוָֽה) could be figurative, particularly if "appear" might be a metaphor. In the Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context, divine manifestations are understood literally. The verb נִרְאָה (nir\'ah) describes a direct, albeit supernatural, visual manifestation of God. This is treated as a literal event within the biblical narrative framework, consistent with the instruction to treat divine anthropomorphisms as literal unless they refer to God\'s body. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The verb נִרְאָה (nir\'ah) means "to be seen" or "to appear." While it implies a visible manifestation, it does not refer to a specific body part of God in the way "God\'s finger" would.

My reasoning is that this is a literal, genealogical, and relational descriptor of God\'s identity and His historical connection to the Israelite patriarchs. It is a factual statement about God\'s covenant relationship. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n4.  **אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵאלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב** (the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob): Similar to the previous phrase, I considered if this could be figurative.

However, the phrase "שמע לקול" (shema leqol, literally "hear the voice of") is a very common biblical idiom meaning "to obey," "to heed," or "to pay attention to the message/command of." In this context, the "voice" of the sign represents the message, divine authority, or implication conveyed by the sign. It is not personification in the sense of attributing full human qualities to the sign, but rather using a human-centric term ("voice") to refer to its communicative function and the demand for a response. This usage clearly falls under the category of a biblical idiom, which the instructions specify should be classified as "idiom." Furthermore, it functions metonymically, where "voice" (a part/aspect) stands for the entire message or authority (the whole). Therefore, I have classified it as both an idiom and metonymy.\n\n3.  **"וְהֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֥ת הָאַחֲרֽוֹן"** (and they will believe the voice of the second sign):\n    *   **Considered:** Similar to the previous phrase, I considered if "לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֥ת" (to the voice of the sign) in conjunction with "וְהֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ" (and they will believe) might be personification, metonymy, or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The construction and meaning are identical to the previous instance. "Believing the voice of the sign" is an idiomatic expression for believing the message, divine authority, or implication that the sign represents. It is not about an audible sound, but about accepting the truth or command conveyed by the sign. This is a clear biblical idiom that also functions metonymically.\n\n**Borderline Cases:**\nThe primary debate was whether "לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֣ת" should be classified as personification or idiom/metonymy. While "voice" is a human attribute, its use here is so conventional in Hebrew to denote message or authority (especially with verbs like "hear" or "believe") that it functions more as a fixed idiom or metonymy rather than a vivid personification intended to imbue the sign with human-like speaking abilities. The instructions explicitly state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, which aligns with this interpretation.\n\n**Phrases marked as figurative in JSON:**\n*   "לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֣ת הָרִאשׁ֑וֹן" (to the voice of the first sign)\n*   "לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֥ת הָאַחֲרֽוֹן" (to the voice of the second sign)\n\nBoth instances are marked as figurative due to their idiomatic and metonymic use of "voice" to represent the message or authority of the sign.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in this context, "signs" refers to literal miraculous demonstrations (e.g., Moses\'s staff turning into a snake, his hand becoming leprous). These are presented as actual, observable events. "Not convinced" (לֹא יַאֲמִינוּ) describes a literal mental state of disbelief.

In biblical Hebrew, the phrase "שמע לקול" (shema lekol) is a well-established idiom that means "to obey," "to heed," or "to listen to" in a sense of compliance, rather than merely perceiving sound. The English translation "do not heed you" accurately captures this idiomatic meaning. This is a clear biblical idiom, fitting the instruction to classify such phrases as "idiom."\n\n3.  **"take some water from the Nile" (וְלָקַחְתָּ֙ מִמֵּימֵ֣י הַיְאֹ֔ר)**: I considered if "Nile" (הַיְאֹר) could be symbolic or if the act of taking water had a deeper, non-literal meaning. However, "Nile" is a proper noun referring to a specific river, and the action of taking water is a literal physical act. This phrase is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"pour it on the dry ground" (וְשָׁפַכְתָּ֖ הַיַּבָּשָׁ֑ה)**: I considered if "dry ground" (הַיַּבָּשָׁה) might be symbolic or if the act of pouring had a figurative meaning. "Dry ground" is a literal description of the earth, and pouring is a literal action. This phrase is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"will turn to blood" (וְהָי֥וּ לְדָ֖ם)**: I considered if this phrase might be a metaphor (water *is* blood) or a simile (water *like* blood). However, the text describes a literal, albeit miraculous and supernatural, transformation of the water\'s substance into blood. It is not using "blood" as a comparison to describe a quality of the water, but stating that the water itself will undergo a physical change to become blood. This is presented as a direct statement of an event, not a figurative comparison or representation. Therefore, this phrase is not figurative.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "וְלֹ֤א יִשְׁמְעוּן֙ לְקֹלֶ֔ךָ" is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

These are classic biblical idioms describing someone who has difficulty speaking, is slow of speech, or has a speech impediment. The mouth and tongue are not literally heavy. Following the instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, I marked both phrases as idioms.\n\nIn summary, the phrases "man of words," "heavy of mouth," and "heavy of tongue" are clear examples of figurative idioms in this text.

I also considered if it is an idiom, given the instruction "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type."\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Hebrew phrase "חָרָה אַף" (charah af) is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew meaning "to be angry" or "anger burned." While the general concept of "God was angry" is presented as a literal anthropomorphism, the *specific linguistic expression* uses a physical manifestation (the burning of the nose/nostrils) to represent an internal emotional state (anger). This is a classic example of an idiom where a physical vehicle (burning nose) conveys an abstract concept (anger). It is not a literal description of God\'s physical nose burning, but a conventional, fixed phrase to express intense anger. Therefore, despite the general instruction on anthropomorphisms, the idiomatic nature of this specific phrase, which uses a body part in a non-literal, conventional way to express an emotion, leads me to classify it as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline:** This was a borderline case due to the tension between the instruction to treat "God was angry" as literal anthropomorphism and the instruction to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as idioms. My decision leans towards classifying the specific Hebrew phrase "חָרָה אַף" as an idiom because it is a fixed expression that uses a physical sensation (burning nose) to represent an abstract emotion (anger), which is a common characteristic of idioms.\n\n2.  **יָדַ֕עְתִּי כִּֽי־דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר ה֑וּא** (He, I know, speaks readily / lit. "I know that speaking he speaks"):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the emphatic infinitive absolute construction "דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר" (dabber yedabber) constitutes figurative language.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard grammatical construction in Hebrew (infinitive absolute followed by a finite verb of the same root) used to emphasize the certainty, intensity, or completeness of an action. It functions as a grammatical intensifier, meaning "he certainly speaks" or "he speaks very well/readily." It is a feature of Hebrew syntax and grammar, not a figurative device like a metaphor, simile, or personification.\n\n3.  **וְשָׂמַ֥ח בְּלִבּֽוֹ** (and he will be happy in his heart):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered whether "בְּלִבּֽוֹ" ("in his heart") should be classified as metonymy for Aaron\'s inner self or emotions.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew and ancient Near Eastern thought, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is understood as the central organ of intellect, will, and emotion. Therefore, stating that someone is "happy in his heart" is a standard and literal way of describing an internal emotional state according to the cultural understanding of the time. It is not a novel comparison, personification, or a non-standard use of the term. It directly describes the location of the emotion as understood by the culture, rather than using a part to represent a whole in a figurative sense.

I also considered if it was a metonymy or a standard biblical idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** God is understood as spirit and does not possess a physical body in the human sense. Therefore, a literal physical presence "with" a mouth is not intended. This phrase is a common biblical **idiom** signifying divine assistance, guidance, or empowerment in the act of speaking. It employs **metonymy** where "mouth" (the organ of speech) represents the act of speaking or the words spoken. God being "with" their mouths means God will inspire, guide, and empower their utterances, ensuring they speak God\'s message.

The instruction to "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE" comparisons of role or function *if they use כָּמֹנִי or כָּמוֹךָ* does not apply here, as the construction uses לְ (for/as), indicating a direct identification rather than a simile of likeness.

This is a clear **metaphor**, identifying Moses\' functional role with the divine. Similar to the previous phrase, the use of לְ (for/as) indicates a direct identification of role and authority, not a simple comparison using כְּ. This establishes a cross-domain comparison between Moses\' authority over Aaron and God\'s authority over creation.\n    *   **Decision:** Marked as figurative (metaphor).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in this immediate context, it is presented as a literal physical object that Moses is instructed to take.

Therefore, it is literal.\n\n2.  **תִּקַּ֣ח בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ** (you shall take in your hand): I considered if "in your hand" could be an idiom for control or authority, similar to how "hand" can be used in other biblical contexts (e.g., "in the hand of God"). However, the instruction here is to physically grasp the rod. The context dictates a literal physical action of holding the object. Thus, it is literal.\n\n3.  **אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעֲשֶׂה־בּ֖וֹ** (with which you shall perform): I considered if the rod "performing" actions implied personification. The Hebrew "תַּעֲשֶׂה־בּ֖וֹ" clearly means "you shall do *with it*", indicating the rod is an instrument, not the agent. Moses is the one performing the actions, using the rod as a tool.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n2.  **וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙** (and said to him): This is a direct report of speech.

It is not figurative.\n4.  **וְאֶרְאֶ֖ה הַעוֹדָ֣ם חַיִּ֑ים** (and see how they are faring / Lit. "whether they are still alive."): I considered if the English translation "how they are faring" might be an idiom or euphemism.

This is a well-established biblical idiom or set phrase used for farewells, conveying a wish for well-being, safety, and prosperity for the departing individual. It is not a literal instruction to physically "go into peace" as a place or a static state, but rather a blessing for a peaceful journey and future.

"that I have put in your hand"): I considered this phrase as a potential idiom or metonymy. "To put in one\'s hand" (שַׂם בְּיָד) is a well-established biblical idiom signifying the granting of power, authority, or control over something. The hand (יָד) here functions as a synecdoche, a part representing the whole capacity for action and control. This is a clear idiom and a form of metonymy.\n\n6.  **וַעֲשִׂיתָ֖ם לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה** (and you shall do them before Pharaoh): This describes a literal action and location. "Before Pharaoh" (לִפְנֵי פַרְעֹה) is a standard spatial/relational phrase, not figurative.\n\n7.  **וַאֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת־לִבּ֔וֹ** (I, however, will stiffen his heart / lit. "I will strengthen his heart"): I considered this phrase as a potential idiom and metaphor. The verb חזק (ḥazaq) means "to be strong, firm, hard." When applied to the heart (לֵב), which in Hebrew thought is the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, it forms a common biblical idiom meaning to make someone obstinate, stubborn, or unyielding in their will. The "heart" is not literally stiffened like a physical object; rather, its *will* or *resolve* is made firm and resistant.

While "son of God" can function as an idiom in various biblical contexts (e.g., for kings, divine beings), the specific phrase "My first-born son" applied to the *entire nation* of Israel functions as a foundational statement of their unique identity and status.

The term "son" is applied to Israel to describe their unique covenantal relationship with God, which is characterized by God\'s love, protection, and expectation of obedience, mirroring a human father-son relationship. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison, mapping the human familial domain onto the divine-national relationship. While "son" becomes a standard theological designation for Israel, its underlying meaning is metaphorical, as the primary, literal meaning of "son" (biological offspring) is not applicable. This falls under the instruction to mark "clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons." The instruction to "never mark as figurative" comparisons of role or function (e.g., \'a prophet like myself\') applies to explicit comparisons using particles like כְּמוֹ, not to direct metaphorical identifications of identity.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** I debated whether this might be considered a "literal statement of equivalence or similarity in function" as per the "never mark as figurative" rule. However, the rule specifically mentions comparisons using כָּמֹנִי or כָּמוֹךָ. "My son" is a direct identification, not an explicit comparison. Furthermore, the identity of "son" for Israel is a foundational theological concept that is inherently metaphorical in its origin, even if it functions as a literal designation of status within the covenant. Given the instruction to mark "clear metaphors," this fits the criterion.\n\n3.  **וְיַֽעַבְדֵ֔נִי** (that he may worship Me): This describes a literal action of service or worship.

However, this is a straightforward, literal description of an action of communication between two individuals. It is standard narrative language. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה" (all the words of יהוה):** I considered if this phrase functions as an idiom or metonymy. The phrase "words of Yahweh" is a very common biblical expression that refers not merely to spoken sounds, but to the entirety of God\'s message, commands, revelation, and divine will. It is a set phrase used to denote divine communication and its content. The instructions explicitly classify "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of Yahweh) as an idiom, and "דִּבְרֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה" operates on a similar principle, representing the divine message originating from God. While it could be argued as metonymy (words standing for the message), "idiom" is a more precise classification given its established use as a set phrase in biblical Hebrew. Therefore, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֣ר שְׁלָח֑וֹ" (which He sent him / that יהוה had committed to him):** I considered if God "sending" or "committing" something to Moses constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. "Sent" and "committed" are actions attributed to God, not references to a physical body part. Thus, within the ANE worldview, these are understood as literal actions of God. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"כׇּל־הָאֹתֹ֖ת" (all the signs):** I considered if "signs" could be figurative. In this context, "signs" refers to specific miraculous events or demonstrations that serve as proof or indicators of divine power and authority. While these events *point to* something beyond themselves, the term "signs" itself is used literally to denote these specific occurrences. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּֽהוּ" (which He commanded him / about which he had been instructed):** Similar to the previous point regarding God\'s actions, I considered if God "commanding" or "instructing" Moses is an anthropomorphism. As per the guidelines, "commanded" or "instructed" are actions attributed to God, not body parts, and are thus considered literal in the ANE context. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only "כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה" is identified as figurative language (an idiom).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, one might consider if "elders" stands in for "the leadership" or "the entire community through its representatives."

It is not using an associated attribute (like "gray hairs" for old people) or a part for the whole, but rather the precise term for the individuals holding that specific status and role. The instructions emphasize being conservative with standard narrative language and historical information, and "elders" falls squarely into this category as a literal description of a social class/role.

However, this phrase is a well-established Hebrew idiom meaning "to obey" or "to heed" someone\'s command or authority, rather than merely perceiving an auditory signal.

While "knowing" God in biblical Hebrew often encompasses recognition of authority, power, and a relationship, the verb ידע (yada\') itself literally carries these broader semantic ranges.

However, the Hebrew verb קרא (qara\') in the Niphal with עַל (al) in a divine context typically means "to be encountered by," "to be revealed to," or "to be called upon by." This describes a direct divine encounter or revelation, which is considered a literal event in the biblical narrative. It is a divine action, and per instructions, divine anthropomorphisms are literal unless they refer to God\'s body. This does not refer to a body part.\n4.  **נֵ֣לְכָה נָּ֡א (Let us go, we pray):** This is a literal expression of a request or exhortation.

While "three days" is a unit of time, it is used here to denote a distance, specifically "the distance covered in three days of travel." This is a common biblical idiom for measuring distance by the time required to traverse it. It functions as a metonymy where the time duration stands for the distance. Therefore, I am classifying it as both an idiom and a metonymy.\n6.  **בַּמִּדְבָּ֗ר (into the wilderness):** This is a literal geographical location.

In biblical Hebrew, this phrase is a well-established idiom used to refer to a general past period, "formerly," "heretofore," or "in times past," rather than literally the two preceding days.

The root רפה (raphah) means "to sink, relax, let go, be slack, be weak." When applied to people, it directly describes a state of being idle, lazy, or lacking vigor. While "slack" can have a physical connotation, in this context, it directly describes their character and behavior (laziness, shirking work). It is not comparing them to a "slack rope" or "slack sail"; it is a direct attribution of a quality that defines their work ethic. The Hebrew word itself encompasses the meaning of being lazy or idle. Therefore, I concluded it is a literal description of their state/character, not a cross-domain comparison, and excluded it as figurative.\n5.  **עַל־כֵּ֗ן הֵ֤ם צֹֽעֲקִים֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר** (that is why they cry, saying): This describes a literal action of crying out and speaking.

This represents a cross-domain comparison where a physical property (heaviness) is transferred to an abstract concept (the burden or difficulty of a task). This constitutes a metaphor. Furthermore, this is a common and conventional way in Hebrew to describe burdensome tasks, thus functioning as an idiom. The instructions specify classifying "figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, I am classifying it as both a metaphor and an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The main debate was whether to consider this a purely literal description of "difficult" (as כבד can also mean difficult) or a metaphorical extension of "heavy."

Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **אֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֣מוּ עֲלֵהֶ֔ם נֹגְשֵׂ֥י פַרְעֹ֖ה** (whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them): I considered if "set over them" (שָׂ֣מוּ עֲלֵהֶ֔ם) might be figurative, perhaps implying a burden or a metaphorical placement. However, this phrase literally describes the act of appointing or placing individuals in a position of authority or oversight. It is a standard narrative description of administrative arrangement. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **מַדּ֡וּעַ לֹא֩ כִלִּיתֶ֨ם חׇקְכֶ֤ם לִלְבֹּן֙** (Why did you not complete your prescribed amount of bricks?): I considered if "חׇקְכֶ֤ם" (your prescribed amount/quota) could be a metaphor or an idiom. The term חֹק (choq) literally refers to a statute, decree, or a fixed portion/task. In this context, it directly denotes the required quantity of bricks. It is a literal term for a quota, not a figurative representation of something else. Similarly, "לִלְבֹּן֙" (to make bricks) is a literal action. Therefore, I concluded this phrase is not figurative.\n\n4.  **כִּתְמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם** (as you did before / as yesterday, the day before yesterday): I considered if this phrase is an idiom. "תְּמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם" literally means "yesterday, the day before yesterday." However, in biblical Hebrew, this combination is a well-established idiom used to refer to "formerly," "in the past," or "as before," indicating a general period of time rather than strictly the two preceding days. It functions as a set phrase to denote past practice or consistency. This fits the guideline for classifying biblical idioms. Therefore, I concluded this is an idiom.\n\n5.  **גַּם־תְּמ֖וֹל גַּם־הַיּֽוֹם** (either yesterday or today / both yesterday and today): I considered if this phrase is figurative. Unlike "כִּתְמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם," this phrase uses "yesterday" and "today" in a literal sense, referring to the immediate past and present days. The taskmasters are specifically inquiring about the performance on these two particular days, contrasting with the general past implied by the preceding idiom. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only "כִּתְמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם" is identified as figurative language (an idiom).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"Overseers" is a literal designation of their role and status within the Israelite community under Egyptian rule. "Came" describes a literal physical movement. Neither element presents a cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic expression.

The verb צעק means to cry out, shout, or call for help. While it conveys intense emotion and a loud vocalization, it is a direct and literal description of the action of expressing distress or complaint vocally and intensely. In the context of oppressed people appealing to a powerful ruler, a loud and impassioned outcry is a plausible and literal human action, not an exaggeration intended to be understood non-literally. It is not a metaphor (they are not *like* something crying), nor is it personification (as humans are literally capable of crying out). It is not a fixed idiom with a non-literal meaning.

"Deal thus" refers to Pharaoh\'s actions, which are literal and directly impacting the Israelites. "Servants" (עֲבָדֶֽיךָ) is a literal description of their status as forced laborers under Pharaoh, and a standard, respectful (though perhaps ironic in this context) term of address for subordinates to a ruler in the Ancient Near East.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n*   **"וּלְבֵנִ֛ים אֹמְרִ֥ים לָ֖נוּ עֲשׂ֑וּ" (yet they demand of us: Make bricks! / literally: and bricks say to us: Make!):** I considered this phrase for personification. The Hebrew text literally states that "bricks *say* to us: Make!". Bricks are inanimate objects and cannot speak or issue commands. Attributing the human action of "speaking" or "demanding" to bricks is a clear instance of personification. The demand, in reality, comes from the Egyptian taskmasters, but the text figuratively gives agency to the object of the labor itself, emphasizing the relentless and inescapable nature of the task. This is included as figurative.\n*   **"וְהִנֵּ֧ה עֲבָדֶ֛יךָ מֻכִּ֖ים" (Thus your servants are being beaten):** I considered if "beaten" could be hyperbole or a metaphor for severe oppression in a general sense. However, in the context of forced labor and slavery in the ancient world, physical beatings were a literal and common form of punishment and enforcement. Therefore, I concluded this is a literal description of physical violence inflicted upon the laborers and not figurative.\n*   **"וְחָטָ֥את עַמֶּֽךָ" (when the fault is with your own people):** I considered if "fault" (חָטָאת) might be a metonymy for the consequences of the fault. However, "fault" here directly refers to the sin or wrongdoing itself, which is a literal attribution of blame to Pharaoh\'s people. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\nNo borderline cases were identified; the personification of bricks is a distinct figurative element, while the other phrases are literal descriptions.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The repetition could also be considered for emphasis.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The Hebrew root רפה (raphah) means "to sink, relax, let drop, be slack, be feeble." When used to describe people, it directly refers to their state of being idle, lazy, or lacking resolve. This is a direct accusation or description of their behavior and character, not a cross-domain comparison. The guidelines state to "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function... Proportional or behavioral comparisons." Describing someone as "idle" or a "shirker" falls under a behavioral description. It is not a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons," "personification," or an "obvious simile." The repetition serves for emphasis but does not inherently make the phrase figurative.

However, in the specific context of brick-making, straw is a literal, essential component. The statement is a direct, literal denial of a physical material required for their work. While the *implication* of withholding straw is to make their task harder and deny them a necessary resource, the word "straw" itself is not being used figuratively to represent the abstract concept of "resources" or "help."

However, the context suggests a literal sense of causing displeasure and distrust.  The phrase describes a concrete effect on Pharaoh\'s perception.  Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3. **"putting a sword in their hands to slay us"**: This phrase is a straightforward description of an action. While "sword" could be considered a metonymy for violence or death, the context makes the literal meaning clear.  It is not figurative.\n\n4. **"May יהוה look upon you"**:  Similar to point 1, this is a standard narrative description of divine action, not figurative.\n\nThere are no clear metaphors, similes, or personifications in this verse.

In the ANE context, and according to the instructions, divine anthropomorphisms (like God being present in a place one can "return to") are to be taken literally unless they refer to God\'s body. Here, Moses is performing a literal action of turning towards God\'s presence to communicate. It is not a metaphor for a change in his inner being or a non-literal shift in relationship, but a direct action within his role. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיֹּאמַ֑ר** (and said):\n    *   **Considered:** This is a verb of speech.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is standard narrative language describing a literal act of speaking.

Moses is directly accusing God of causing literal suffering or misfortune to the people. This is a straightforward description of an action and its consequence, not a metaphorical expression or an idiom. It is not figurative.\n\n5.  **לָ֥מָּה זֶּ֖ה שְׁלַחְתָּֽנִי** (Why did You send me?):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "send me" (שְׁלַחְתָּֽנִי) might be an idiom for a divine commission or a metaphorical journey.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb שלח literally means "to send."

"To speak in one\'s name" is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not imply a literal speaking *inside* a name, nor is it a direct metaphor.

God "saying" is an action, not a specific body part in the restrictive sense implied by the "finger" example. Therefore, this is interpreted as a literal statement of divine communication.\n\n2.  **"עַתָּ֣ה תִרְאֶ֔ה" (You shall soon see):**\n    *   Considered: If "seeing" here might be metaphorical for understanding or experiencing.\n    *   Reasoning: While "seeing" can sometimes be metaphorical, in this immediate context, it refers to Moses literally witnessing the events that God will bring about. There is no clear cross-domain comparison or obvious figurative intent. Thus, it is considered literal.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה לְפַרְעֹ֑ה" (what I will do to Pharaoh):**\n    *   Considered: If "doing" could be a euphemism or figurative expression for a specific action.\n    *   Reasoning: "Doing" (עָשָׂה) is a very general verb for action. In this context, it refers to God\'s literal interventions and judgments against Pharaoh. No figurative meaning is apparent.\n\n4.  **"כִּ֣י בְיָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔ם" (because of a greater might he shall let them go / by a strong hand he shall let them go):**\n    *   Considered: If `בְיָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙` ("by a strong hand") is a literal hand or a figurative expression.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase `בְיָד חֲזָקָה` is a well-established biblical idiom for overwhelming power, force, or authority. While "hand" (יָד) is a body part, the phrase as a whole functions as a fixed expression representing abstract power rather than a literal physical hand (whether God\'s or Pharaoh\'s). It is a synecdoche (a type of metonymy) where a part (hand) stands for the whole (power/agency). The English translation "greater might" accurately captures this idiomatic understanding. This fits the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. It is also a metonymy.\n\n5.  **"וּבְיָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖ם מֵאַרְצֽוֹ" (indeed, because of a greater might he shall drive them from his land / by a strong hand he shall drive them from his land):**\n    *   Considered: If `וּבְיָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה` ("by a strong hand") is a literal hand or a figurative expression.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a direct repetition of the idiom discussed above.

The act of "appearing" (from ראה, to see/appear) describes God\'s manifestation or presence being perceived, which is a standard narrative description of divine interaction.

The verb in the Nifal (with Hifil sense) means "to be made known" or "to make oneself known." The negative simply states that this particular aspect of God\'s identity (His name YHWH) was not revealed to them in the same way it would be to Moses.

The verb קוּם (qum) in the Hiphil means "to cause to stand, establish, confirm." A covenant (בְּרִית) is an abstract agreement. Treating an abstract concept like a covenant as something that can be "made to stand" or "established" could be seen as a conceptual metaphor where an abstract entity is given physical properties.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion (as idiom):** However, this phrase is a very common and fixed expression in biblical Hebrew for initiating, confirming, or ratifying a covenant (e.g., Genesis 6:18, 9:11, 17:7, Exodus 6:4). The instructions explicitly state that "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Given its conventional and frequent usage, it functions as a standard idiom rather than a fresh, creative metaphor. Therefore, it is classified as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** It could be argued that it is a "dead metaphor" or a "conventional metaphor" due to its underlying conceptualization. However, the instruction to classify such fixed phrases as "idiom" takes precedence.\n\n2.  **לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן** (to give them the land of Canaan)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "give them the land" could be a metonymy, where "land" might stand for the resources of the land, the people inhabiting it, or the authority over it.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** In this context, God is literally promising to transfer the physical territory of Canaan to the Israelites as an inheritance. The primary meaning is the literal geographical entity and its possession. There is no indication that "land" is used to represent something else in a figurative sense. This is a literal statement of action and object.\n\n3.  **אֵ֛ת אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻרֵיהֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽהּ** (the land in which they lived as sojourners)\n    *   **Considered:** No obvious figurative elements were identified in this descriptive phrase.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a straightforward, literal description of the land, identifying it by the past status of the patriarchs (sojourners) within it.

However, the instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." God hearing is an action attributed to God, not a specific body part like a "finger." In the ANE context, a deity hearing is understood as their direct perception and awareness.

God "remembering" a covenant in the biblical context signifies His active engagement with and fulfillment of His promises, not a recovery from amnesia. Following the instruction to treat divine anthropomorphisms as literal in the ANE context (unless referring to a specific body part), this is considered a literal statement of God\'s active commitment and intention to act.\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, particularly regarding divine anthropomorphisms, no figurative language is identified in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While "under" can sometimes be used metaphorically, "labors" (סִבְלֹת) refers to the literal heavy tasks and burdens imposed by the Egyptians. Being "under" these burdens is a common and direct way to describe being subjected to and oppressed by them. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and to only mark clear metaphors, I determined this phrase describes their literal state of being subjected to oppressive tasks rather than a distinct cross-domain comparison. It is not a clear metaphor or idiom in the sense of the examples provided. I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n4.  **וְהִצַּלְתִּ֥י אֶתְכֶ֖ם מֵעֲבֹדָתָ֑ם (and deliver you from their bondage)**: I considered if this phrase contained any figurative language.

I considered if this is a literal description of God\'s physical arm. However, the instructions explicitly state that divine anthropomorphisms referring to God\'s body (e.g., "God\'s finger") should be marked as figurative. An "arm" is a part of God\'s body. Therefore, it is not to be taken literally as God having a physical arm. Instead, it functions as:\n        *   **Metonymy**: The "arm" (a part of the body, or an instrument of action) stands for God\'s power, strength, and active intervention.\n        *   **Metaphor**: The physical act of stretching out an arm to exert force or perform a mighty deed is used metaphorically to describe God\'s powerful and decisive intervention in history. It\'s a cross-domain comparison where a human physical action represents divine omnipotence.\n        *   **Idiom**: "Outstretched arm" (זְרוֹעַ נְטוּיָה) is a well-established biblical idiom for God\'s mighty and visible acts of deliverance and judgment. It is a set phrase with a conventional figurative meaning.\n    *   This phrase clearly fits the criteria for figurative language as it refers to a divine body part and functions as a metonymy, metaphor, and idiom for divine power and action. I am including it as figurative.\n\n6.  **וּבִשְׁפָטִ֖ים גְּדֹלִֽים (and through extraordinary chastisements)**: I considered if this phrase contained any figurative language. "Chastisements" (שְׁפָטִים) refers to literal acts of judgment or punishment, and "extraordinary" (גְּדֹלִים, literally "great") is a literal descriptor of their magnitude. This is standard narrative language describing divine actions.

However, in the context of covenant formation, "taking" a people is a standard, literal description of divine election and the establishment of a unique relationship, not a physical act of carrying or moving.

The "labors" or "burdens" (סִבְל֥וֹת) themselves are literal oppressive tasks. However, being "from *under* the labors/burdens" uses a spatial preposition ("under") metaphorically to describe a state of subjugation, oppression, and being weighed down by these burdens. One is not literally physically "under" abstract "labors." This is a clear spatial metaphor for a state of severe oppression and control. It is also a common idiomatic expression in Hebrew to describe enslavement or severe hardship. Therefore, I am marking this as both a metaphor and an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

I also considered if it was an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** While it involves a divine body part (hand), the phrase "to raise one\'s hand" is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew for swearing an oath or making a solemn promise. The footnote explicitly highlights its idiomatic nature ("swore Lit. \'raised My hand.\'"). The instructions state that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase perfectly fits that description. It\'s not describing a literal physical action of God\'s hand, but rather conveying the act of making a binding oath through a conventional, symbolic human gesture.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The borderline aspect lies in distinguishing it from a literal anthropomorphism. The instructions state that divine anthropomorphisms are literal "unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." While "hand" is a body part, the *action* of "raising the hand" in this specific context is universally understood as an idiomatic expression for swearing, rather than a direct description of God\'s physical anatomy or movement. The idiomatic meaning ("to swear") overrides a purely literal physical interpretation.\n\n3.  **"לָתֵ֣ת אֹתָ֔הּ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֑ב" (to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob):** This is a straightforward statement of divine action and historical promise.

While "not listening" can sometimes carry an idiomatic sense of disobedience or refusal to heed advice, in this context, the subsequent phrase provides the *reason* for their inability to listen: "because of shortness of spirit and hard labor." This explanation suggests that their inability to listen was not merely an act of defiance but a profound psychological and physical exhaustion that rendered them incapable of processing or accepting Moses\' words of hope. Therefore, I classify this as a literal description of their state of unresponsiveness due to overwhelming circumstances, rather than a figurative idiom for simple disobedience.\n\n3.  **מִקֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ** (because of shortness of spirit / their spirits crushed): This is the primary candidate for figurative language.\n    *   I considered if this is a metaphor, an idiom, or both. The Hebrew phrase "קֹצֶר ר֔וּחַ" (qotzer ruach) literally translates to "shortness of spirit/breath."

Instead, a psychological state of despair, impatience, lack of endurance, or overwhelming distress is being described using a physical attribute (shortness, as one might experience shortness of breath under duress, or a "short temper"). This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison, making it a metaphor. As a fixed phrase with a non-literal, conventional meaning, it also functions as an idiom. The English translation "their spirits crushed" is an interpretive rendering of this idiomatic metaphor.\n\n4.  **וּמֵעֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה** (and by cruel bondage / and because of hard labor): This phrase describes the physical reality of their situation.

It is a set phrase for prayer or direct address.

In this instance, the Israelites "not listening" to Moses directly implies their failure to obey or heed his words or commands. This is not a distinct figurative expression or idiom, but rather a core meaning within the verb\'s established semantic field. It is standard narrative language describing their lack of compliance.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְאֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה** (how then should Pharaoh heed me / how will Pharaoh hear me):\n    *   **Considered**: Similar to the above, if "יִשְׁמָעֵ֣נִי" (will hear/heed me) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This phrase uses the same verb שמע in a parallel construction, referring to Pharaoh\'s potential response to Moses\' words.

This immediately signals a non-literal, figurative meaning. The concept of "uncircumcised" (ערל), which typically refers to a physical condition (foreskin) or more broadly to something closed off, unprepared, or unheeding (e.g., "uncircumcised ears," "uncircumcised heart"), is transferred to the domain of speech (lips). This cross-domain mapping constitutes a clear **metaphor**. The "uncircumcised" state here implies an impediment, a lack of fluency, or an inability to speak effectively or persuasively. Furthermore, this is a recognized and established expression in biblical Hebrew to describe difficulty in speaking, making it a **figurative idiom**. The provided note also explicitly highlights its figurative nature.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark as both metaphor and idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The act of "speaking" does not refer to a specific body part of God, but rather describes a mode of divine communication. Therefore, in this ANE narrative context, it is considered a literal description of God\'s action and is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **"אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאֶֽל־אַהֲרֹן֒" (to both Moses and Aaron):**\n    *   Considered: This is a straightforward reference to specific individuals.\n    *   Reasoning: No figurative elements are present.

It\'s a direct reference to the parties involved in the divine instruction given to Moses and Aaron. It functions as standard narrative language identifying the subjects and recipients of the command, rather than a substitution of an attribute for the whole.

When applied to a group or organization, such as "head of a clan" or "head of a family," it involves a transfer of meaning from the physical domain (body part) to the social/organizational domain (leader). This cross-domain mapping is characteristic of metaphor. However, this usage is extremely common and conventionalized in biblical Hebrew, functioning as a standard term for a leader or chief. The instructions state to classify "figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type" and to be conservative with standard narrative language. Given its pervasive and conventional use, it functions as a lexicalized metaphor, which can be considered an idiom in this context. It is not a fresh, striking comparison but a standard way of referring to leadership. Therefore, I will classify it as both a metaphor (due to the underlying cross-domain mapping) and an idiom (due to its conventionalized and standard usage).\n    *   **Borderline cases**: This was the primary borderline case. The debate was whether its conventionality makes it "not figurative" according to the conservative guidelines, or if its metaphorical origin still qualifies it, especially if it can be categorized as an "idiom."

The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (e.g., God\'s finger).

The phrase "עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽם" (by their hosts/armies) is a recurring, set phrase in the Exodus narrative (e.g., Ex 6:26, 7:4, 12:17, 12:41, 12:51, Num 33:1). While "hosts" can be a literal description of groups, its application to the entire nation of Israel, including women and children, departing from Egypt, carries a specific, elevated meaning beyond merely "in their groups." It functions as an idiom to convey the idea of a divinely ordered, powerful, and numerous procession, emphasizing God\'s organization and might in leading His people out, almost as a disciplined army.

It does not imply a literal physical "front" to God in a human sense, but rather a relational or authoritative presence.

So, literally, "uncircumcised lips."\n        *   **Metaphor:** The concept of being "uncircumcised" (typically referring to the foreskin, implying being closed, hindered, or unfit for a particular function or covenant) is applied to the "lips." This creates a cross-domain comparison where the physical state of being uncircumcised is used to describe a functional impediment related to speech. It vividly conveys an inability to speak clearly, fluently, or effectively. This is a clear metaphor.\n        *   **Idiom:** This phrase also functions as a fixed idiom in Hebrew to express difficulty in speech, a speech impediment, or an inability to articulate. Similar idioms exist for other senses (e.g., "uncircumcised ears" for inability to hear/understand, "uncircumcised heart" for spiritual dullness). The English translation "tongue-tied" is itself an idiom for this condition. Given the instructions, it fits the criteria for both metaphor and idiom.\n    *   *Borderline cases:* I debated whether to classify it solely as an idiom or also as a metaphor. I concluded it is both, as the idiomatic expression is built upon a metaphorical comparison. The instructions allow for multiple types.\n\n3.  **"וְאֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖י פַּרְעֹֽה" (how then should Pharaoh heed me! / how then will Pharaoh listen to me):**\n    *   *Considered:* If "יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖י" (listen to me / heed me) is figurative.\n    *   *Reasoning:* While "to hear" (שמע) can semantically extend to "to obey" or "to heed," this is a common semantic shift rather than a distinct figurative device like a metaphor or simile. Moses is literally asking how Pharaoh will pay attention to and act upon his words. This is standard narrative language and a literal question about Pharaoh\'s response.\n    *   *Borderline cases:* None; this is a literal statement.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

God is establishing Moses\'s new functional identity and authority *vis-à-vis* Pharaoh. Moses will literally act as God\'s representative, wielding divine power and authority in Pharaoh\'s eyes. This is a statement of functional equivalence, not a figurative simile or a metaphor in the sense of a non-literal comparison.

It falls squarely under the "comparisons of role or function" guideline, which explicitly states such comparisons are "literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function." Aaron will literally serve as Moses\'s spokesperson, conveying Moses\'s (and thus God\'s) words to Pharaoh.

The verb חזק (chazaq), meaning "to be strong, firm, hard, stiffen," when applied to the heart, is a well-established biblical idiom describing stubbornness, obstinacy, or an unyielding disposition. It signifies Pharaoh\'s resolve not to comply, not a literal calcification of his physical heart. Therefore, it functions as both an idiom and a metaphor. The heart (target) is metaphorically likened to something that can become stiff or hard (vehicle), conveying the ground of resistance and stubbornness.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** While the concept of the "heart" is central to human experience, its use here is clearly beyond a purely anatomical description, pointing to an internal, volitional state.

However, the instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." God speaking is a standard anthropomorphic action that does not refer to a specific body part in a figurative way. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה** (Pharaoh\'s heart is heavy/stubborn): This is the primary phrase I examined for figurative language.\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if this is a metaphor, an idiom, or both. The literal translation is "heavy heart of Pharaoh."\n    *   **Reasoning**: In biblical Hebrew, the phrase "heavy heart" (כָּבֵד לֵב) is a well-established idiom used to describe a state of stubbornness, dullness, unresponsiveness, or an unyielding disposition. It is not meant to be understood as a literal physical heaviness of the organ. This constitutes a cross-domain mapping where a physical attribute (heaviness) is used to describe a psychological or volitional state (stubbornness). This clearly functions as a **metaphor**. Furthermore, as a fixed expression with a conventional non-literal meaning, it also qualifies as an **idiom** according to the provided guidelines ("Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type"). I have decided to mark it as both metaphor and idiom, as idioms often originate from metaphorical expressions and retain their metaphorical quality.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: The main debate was whether to classify it *only* as an idiom or also as a metaphor. Given that the instructions allow for multiple types and that the metaphorical nature is evident (physical heaviness for psychological stubbornness), marking both provides a more complete analysis.\n\n3.  **מֵאֵ֖ן לְשַׁלַּ֥ח הָעָֽם** (he refuses to let the people go): I considered this phrase as standard narrative language describing Pharaoh\'s direct action and refusal. There is no indication of figurative language here. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only "כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה" is marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n*   **"הִנֵּה֙ יֹצֵ֣א הַמַּ֔יְמָה" (as he is coming out to the water):** I considered if "coming out to the water" might imply a ritualistic or symbolic act beyond mere physical movement.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n*   **"וְנִצַּבְתָּ֥ לִקְרָאת֖וֹ" (and station yourself before him):** I considered if "station yourself before him" could be an idiom for a formal confrontation or audience.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n*   **"עַל־שְׂפַ֣ת הַיְאֹ֑ר" (at the edge of the Nile / lit. "on the lip of the river"):** I considered if the use of "שְׂפַת" (s\'fat), meaning "lip," to describe the "edge" or "bank" of the Nile constitutes personification or a metaphor. While "lip" is a human body part, its application to the edge of a river, sea, or vessel is a very common and conventional usage in Biblical Hebrew (and other languages). It does not attribute human-like actions, feelings, or a novel comparison to the river. Instead, it is a fixed expression that functions as an idiom for "bank" or "shore." This usage is a conventional extension of meaning rather than active personification or a fresh metaphor. Therefore, I classified it as an idiom. This was the only borderline case, and I concluded it fits the definition of a biblical idiom/set phrase as per the instructions.\n*   **"וְהַמַּטֶּ֛ה אֲשֶׁר־נֶהְפַּ֥ךְ לְנָחָ֖שׁ" (and the rod that turned into a snake):** I considered if the transformation itself is figurative. However, the narrative explicitly states that the rod *literally* turned into a snake as a miraculous sign (Exodus 7:10). This is a description of a past literal event, not a figurative comparison or statement in this context. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n*   **"תִּקַּ֥ח בְּיָדֶֽךָ" (taking with you in your hand):** I considered if "in your hand" could be an idiom for "under your control" or "with your authority." However, the context is a literal instruction to physically carry the rod. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In this context, Pharaoh has clearly received the message (Moses is delivering it), so the issue is not that he hasn\'t physically heard it, but that he has not *complied* or *obeyed* the command.

The river itself, as a geographical entity, does not "stink" in a human-like way; rather, its contents (the water and dead fish) will emit a foul odor.

Such conventional references, where the container or location stands for its contents, are generally considered standard narrative language rather than a distinct figurative device requiring special marking, especially given the instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Standard narrative language" and the specific examples provided for idioms and other figurative types.

Given the preceding description that the Nile will stink, it is a literal and direct consequence that the water would be so repulsive and potentially harmful that the Egyptians would genuinely be unable or find it extremely difficult to drink it. This is a factual description of their physical and psychological inability to consume the putrid water, not an exaggeration. It aligns with standard narrative language describing a severe outcome.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis and adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language is identified in this verse.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, this is a standard narrative statement describing divine action. The instructions state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be treated as literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. "God commanded" falls under this category as a literal statement of divine communication and action, not a figurative comparison. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **"וַיָּ֤רֶם בַּמַּטֶּה֙" (he lifted up the rod)**: I considered if this phrase was figurative. This describes a straightforward, literal physical action performed by Moses. There is no metaphorical, similetic, or personifying element present. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **"וַיַּ֤ךְ אֶת־הַמַּ֙יִם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּיְאֹ֔ר" (and struck the water in the Nile)**: I considered if "struck the water" was figurative. This is a literal description of Moses\'s physical action with the rod. The rod made physical contact with the water. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **"לְעֵינֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה וּלְעֵינֵ֖י עֲבָדָ֑יו" (in the sight of Pharaoh and his courtiers)**: I considered if this phrase, literally "to the eyes of Pharaoh and to the eyes of his servants," is figurative. This is a clear and common biblical idiom. The phrase "לְעֵינֵי" (l\'einei) is consistently used in Hebrew to mean "in the presence of" or "before" someone, rather than literally implying the action occurs *within* their eyes. It uses a part (eyes) to represent the whole act of observation or presence, which is a form of metonymy embedded within the idiom. As per instructions, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom." This is a definite instance of figurative language.\n\n5.  **"וַיֵּהָ֥פְכ֛וּ כׇּל־הַמַּ֥יִם אֲשֶׁר־בַּיְאֹ֖ר לְדָֽם" (and all the water in the Nile was turned into blood)**: I considered if this miraculous transformation was figurative (e.g., a metaphor or simile). While the event itself is supernatural, the narrative presents it as a literal physical change: the water *actually* became blood. It does not state the water was *like* blood (simile) or that it *symbolically represented* blood (metaphor in a non-literal sense). The text describes a direct, physical transformation. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and character actions, and to only mark clear metaphors, personification, or obvious similes, this is treated as a literal description of a miraculous event within the narrative. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only the phrase "לְעֵינֵי פַרְעֹה וּלְעֵינֵי עֲבָדָיו" is identified as figurative language (an idiom with metonymic characteristics).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in a narrative context describing a plague, the death of fish is a direct, literal consequence of the water turning to blood. There is no indication of figurative meaning here.\n\n2.  **"וַיִּבְאַ֣שׁ הַיְאֹ֔ר" / "The Nile stank"**: I considered if this phrase constituted personification, as if the river itself were performing an action or experiencing a sensation. However, "stank" (בָּאַשׁ) is a verb that describes the condition of the water due to the dead fish and pollution. Rivers, when polluted, literally emit foul odors. Therefore, this is a literal description of the river\'s state, not personification. I also considered if it could be a metaphor for the severity of the plague, but it directly describes a physical outcome.\n\n3.  **"וְלֹא־יָכְל֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם לִשְׁתּ֥וֹת מַ֖יִם מִן־הַיְאֹ֑ר" / "so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile"**: I considered if "could not drink" might be hyperbole, implying extreme difficulty rather than absolute impossibility. However, given the description of the water stinking and being blood, it is a literal consequence that the water became undrinkable. This is a direct statement of fact within the narrative.\n\n4.  **"וַיְהִ֥י הַדָּ֖ם בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם" / "and there was blood throughout the land of Egypt"**:\n    *   **"הַדָּ֖ם" / "blood"**: I considered if "blood" here was a metaphor or metonymy for death, judgment, or a severe affliction.

Within the narrative\'s framework of a miraculous plague, the substance is presented as literal blood, not something *like* blood. Therefore, it is not a metaphor or simile.\n    *   **"בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם" / "throughout the land of Egypt"**: I considered if this phrase was hyperbole, suggesting an exaggeration of the plague\'s geographical reach (i.e., not literally every single spot). However, "בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ" (in all the land) is a standard biblical idiom/set phrase for describing widespread occurrence or comprehensive impact. While it might not imply every square inch, it literally means "in all the land" and is understood as a statement of the plague\'s extensive geographical scope, affecting all significant water sources. It is a literal descriptor of extent rather than an exaggeration for rhetorical effect. It is not a figurative idiom in the sense of a cross-domain comparison, but a literal descriptor of scope.\n\nBased on this conservative analysis, no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, or hyperbole are present in this verse.

It represents the seat of intellect, emotion, and decision-making. This is a common biblical idiom.\n        *   **"וַיֶּחֱזַק" (stiffened/hardened):** When this verb is is used in conjunction with "heart" (לֵב), it functions as a metaphor. A physical heart does not literally become stiff or hard in a physiological sense. Instead, the physical quality of "stiffening" is used to describe a psychological state of stubbornness, resistance, or unyielding resolve. This is a clear cross-domain comparison (physical stiffness to psychological stubbornness) and a very common biblical idiom for describing an unchangeable or resistant disposition.\n    *   Decision: Include as idiom, metaphor, and metonymy.\n\n3.  **וְלֹא־שָׁמַ֣ע אֲלֵהֶ֔ם** (and he did not heed them)\n    *   Considered: If "did not heed" (וְלֹא־שָׁמַ֣ע אֲלֵהֶ֔ם) could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal description of Pharaoh\'s refusal to listen or obey.

However, the guidelines state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The act of "saying" is an action, not a reference to a specific body part like a finger. In the ANE worldview, divine speech was understood as a direct and literal communication.

While the plague would certainly affect the people, the primary and most direct meaning is that the geographical territory itself will be infested with frogs.

However, the guidelines explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "said" refers to an action and not a specific body part of God, it is considered a literal statement of divine communication in this context.\n\n2.  **נְטֵ֤ה אֶת־יָדְךָ֙ (Hold out your arm)**: I considered if "arm" (יָדְךָ֙) might be a metonymy for power or authority. However, in this context, it is a direct, literal command for Aaron to physically extend his arm to perform an action with the rod. There is no indication that the arm itself is being used to represent something other than the physical limb. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **בְּמַטֶּ֔ךָ (with the rod)**: I considered if the rod might be a symbol or metonymy for divine power or authority. While the rod is an instrument through which divine power is manifested, the text refers to the rod as a literal object to be held and used. It is not being called "power" or "authority" itself, but rather the means by which an action is to be performed. Thus, it is a literal object in a literal action.\n\n4.  **עַ֨ל־הַנְּהָרֹ֔ת עַל־הַיְאֹרִ֖ים וְעַל־הָאֲגַמִּ֑ים (over the rivers, the canals, and the ponds)**: I considered if this enumeration of water bodies might constitute a merism, representing all bodies of water in Egypt. While it might imply a comprehensive scope, the phrase itself is a literal list of specific geographical features. It is not a figurative expression where parts stand for a whole in a non-literal sense, but rather a direct description of the areas over which the rod is to be held.\n\n5.  **וְהַ֥עַל אֶת־הַֽצְפַרְדְּעִ֖ים (and bring up the frogs)**: This is a direct command for a supernatural event. The language used to describe the action ("bring up") and the object ("frogs") is entirely literal. There is no metaphorical, personifying, or other figurative element in this command.\n\n6.  **עַל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם (on the land of Egypt)**: I considered if "land of Egypt" might be a metonymy for the people or nation of Egypt. However, in this context, the frogs are literally to come up onto the physical territory of Egypt. The phrase refers to the geographical entity, not figuratively to its inhabitants.\n\nIn conclusion, after a thorough review of each phrase against the provided guidelines, I find no instances of clear metaphors, personification, obvious similes, or biblical idioms/set phrases that would qualify as figurative language in this verse.

I considered if "said" could be figurative, but it is a literal report of dialogue.\n2.  **הִתְפָּאֵ֣ר עָלַי֒** (You may have this triumph over me / Boast over me): I considered if this phrase constituted an idiom or a metaphor. The verb הִתְפָּאֵר (hitpa\'er) means "to glorify oneself, boast, triumph." The phrase עָלַי (ʿalay) means "over me" or "against me." Moses is literally inviting Pharaoh to choose the time for the plague\'s removal, thereby allowing Pharaoh to "boast" or "triumph" in the sense of dictating the terms of the divine action. While there might be an ironic undertone, the literal meaning of "glorify yourself over me" or "boast over me" remains direct. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), a comparison using "like" or "as" (simile), nor does it attribute human qualities to non-humans (personification). It is also not an idiom whose meaning is opaque from its constituent words; the meaning is directly derived from the verb\'s sense of self-glorification or triumph. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n3.  **לְמָתַ֣י׀ אַעְתִּ֣יר לְךָ֗** (for what time shall I plead in behalf of you): The verb אַעְתִּיר (aʿtîr) means "I will entreat, intercede, pray." This describes a literal action of prayer or intercession.

In the context of a plague, "cut off" refers to the literal removal and extermination of the frogs. I considered if "cut off" could be a metaphor, but it directly describes the physical elimination of the frogs from the specified locations.\n6.  **מִמְּךָ֖ וּמִבָּתֶּ֑יךָ** (from you and your houses): "From you" refers to Pharaoh\'s person, and "your houses" refers to his physical dwellings. I considered if "houses" could be metonymy for "households" or "families," but in the context of frogs being physically present and removed, it most directly refers to the physical structures. Thus, it is literal.\n7.  **רַ֥ק בַּיְאֹ֖ר תִּשָּׁאַֽרְנָה** (to remain only in the Nile): This is a literal statement about the intended location of the frogs.

It means "there is no one *who is* like YHWH" in terms of being God or possessing His divine attributes. This is a statement of absolute, literal uniqueness, not a figurative comparison that likens God to something else (e.g., "God is like a rock"). The guidelines state that "comparisons of role or function" or "proportional or behavioral comparisons" should *never* be marked as figurative. This statement falls under the spirit of such literal comparisons, asserting God\'s unique status and identity rather than employing a figurative image.\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the text explicitly states the frogs will retreat *from* these individuals. The frogs were literally on or among these people. This is a direct reference to a group of people, not a figurative representation of something else. Therefore, it is not metonymy or synecdoche.\n\n5.  **וּמֵעַמֶּ֑ךָ** (and from your people): Similar to "courtiers/servants," I considered if "your people" might be metonymy for the land or the general populace in a broader, abstract sense.

Therefore, it is not metonymy.\n\n6.  **רַ֥ק בַּיְאֹ֖ר תִּשָּׁאַֽרְנָה** (they shall remain only in the Nile): This describes the literal physical location where the frogs will subsequently be found.

Therefore, not figurative.\n\n2.  **מֵעִ֣ם פַּרְעֹ֑ה** (Pharaoh’s presence / from with Pharaoh): I considered if this phrase might be an idiom or a form of metonymy, where "Pharaoh\'s presence" stands for his authority or court. However, the Hebrew prepositional phrase מֵעִם (me\'im) literally means "from with" or "from beside." It describes a direct physical departure from Pharaoh\'s immediate vicinity or company. It is a standard spatial and relational descriptor in Hebrew narrative and does not carry a non-literal meaning akin to the examples provided for idioms (e.g., "face of the earth"). Therefore, not figurative.\n\n3.  **וַיִּצְעַ֤ק מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֔ה** (and Moses cried out to יהוה): I considered if "cried out" (וַיִּצְעַק) could be a metaphor for intense prayer or supplication, implying a deeper spiritual act beyond a mere vocalization. However, the verb צָעַק (tsa\'aq) literally means to cry out, shout, or call for help. While it certainly conveys the intensity of Moses\'s prayer, it describes a literal vocal action. It is standard narrative language for expressing distress or making an earnest appeal. Therefore, not figurative.\n\n4.  **עַל־דְּב֥ר הַֽצְפַרְדְּעִ֖ים** (in the matter of the frogs): I considered if "in the matter of" (עַל־דְּבַר) or "the frogs" could be part of an idiom or a figurative expression. "עַל־דְּבַר" is a standard prepositional phrase meaning "concerning" or "on account of," and "הַֽצְפַרְדְּעִ֖ים" refers to literal creatures.

The verb שִׂים (sim) means "to put, place, set." In the context of a plague, it means to inflict or bring upon. The frogs were literally brought upon Pharaoh and his land. This is a direct description of the plague\'s manifestation and impact, not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or an idiom with a non-literal meaning.

The repetition "חֳמָרִ֣ים חֳמָרִ֑ים" (heaps, heaps) is a common Hebrew stylistic device used for intensification, indicating a very large quantity or numerous separate piles. While it conveys an extreme abundance, it describes a literal, albeit extensive, reality of the dead frogs being gathered into many, many heaps.

While "the land" (הָאָֽרֶץ) is an inanimate entity, the act of "stinking" is not exclusively a human or animate quality. Many inanimate things (e.g., decaying organic matter, garbage) can "stink." When applied to "the land," it signifies that the land was the source or locus of a pervasive foul odor, not that the land itself possessed an olfactory sense or experienced a personal sensation of foulness. Therefore, it does not attribute a human-like quality to the land.\n    *   **Reasoning for metonymy inclusion:** The phrase "the land stank" uses "the land" (הָאָֽרֶץ), which refers to the physical ground or geographical area, to represent the *entire environment* or *atmosphere* of that area. The stench did not literally emanate from the soil itself, but from the immense quantity of decaying frogs *lying on* the land. Thus, "the land" functions as a container or location that stands for the pervasive foul odor that filled the air and affected the entire region. This is a form of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where the container stands for its contents or the location for the condition within it). The phrase concisely attributes the pervasive stench to the entire region by naming its surface.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One could argue for a very broad literal interpretation where "the land" refers to the general area, which literally stank. However, understanding "land" as the physical ground makes the metonymic interpretation more precise, as the ground itself isn\'t the source of the smell, but rather what is *on* it. The phrase is a concise way to describe the widespread environmental impact.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Metonymy.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The "heart" (לֵב) in Hebrew thought is often used metonymically to represent the inner person, including one\'s will, intellect, and emotions, rather than just the physical organ. The act of "hardening" or "making heavy" the heart is a metaphor for a psychological state of stubbornness, obstinacy, or resistance to persuasion. It is not a literal hardening of the physical organ.

While it is a set phrase, the core "אָמַר יְהֹוָה" (YHWH said) is an anthropomorphism of an action (speaking).

"כֹּה אָמַר יְהֹוָה" does not involve a body part in a figurative sense, but rather states that God performed the action of speaking. Therefore, consistent with the conservative approach to divine anthropomorphisms of action, this phrase is not marked as figurative.\n7.  **שַׁלַּ֥ח עַמִּ֖י** (Let My people go): "My people" (עַמִּ֖י) describes a literal possessive relationship between God and the Israelites.

It falls under standard narrative language and divine action, which are to be treated as literal.\n\n2.  **"פְדֻ֔ת" (distinction/redemption):** The English translation notes "Meaning of peduth uncertain," rendering it as "distinction."

It is the direct object or result of God\'s action, not a metaphorical comparison or personification.

However, the Hebrew verb וַיָּבֹא֙ literally means "and it came" or "and it entered." A swarm of insects physically enters and occupies spaces, so this is a literal description of their movement and presence.

The Hebrew word תּוֹעֵבָה (to\'evah) literally means "abomination," "detestable thing," or "taboo." In this context, Moses is stating that the animals they sacrifice to YHWH are literally considered an abomination or detestable by the Egyptians, likely because certain animals (like cattle) were sacred to Egyptians or considered ritually impure for sacrifice by them. It is a direct classification of the sacrificial animals from the Egyptian cultural and religious perspective, not a comparison or a non-literal expression. It describes the inherent status of the act/object in that cultural context. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"הֵ֣ן נִזְבַּ֞ח אֶת־תּוֹעֲבַ֥ת מִצְרַ֛יִם לְעֵינֵיהֶ֖ם" (If we sacrifice that which is untouchable to the Egyptians before their very eyes)**:\n    *   **"תּוֹעֲבַ֥ת מִצְרַ֛יִם" (abomination of Egypt / untouchable to the Egyptians)**: This is the same phrase as analyzed in point 2.

However, in the ancient Near East (ANE) context, expressing distance in terms of travel time (e.g., "a day\'s journey") was a standard and literal way of measurement.

While his sincerity might be questioned by the reader, the words themselves describe a literal act of release. It does not employ metaphor, simile, or any other figurative device.\n\n3.  **"וּזְבַחְתֶּ֞ם לַיהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶם֙ בַּמִּדְבָּ֔ר" (to sacrifice to your God יהוה in the wilderness):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether the act of "sacrificing to your God" could be a euphemism or a figurative representation of worship in general, or if "wilderness" might carry symbolic weight.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Sacrificing was a literal, prescribed religious ritual in the ancient Near East. "Your God יהוה" is a literal reference to the deity, and "in the wilderness" is a literal geographical location.

I considered if this grammatical emphasis constitutes an idiom or a form of hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While emphatic, this is a standard grammatical device for intensifying the meaning of a verb, not a figurative idiom with a non-literal meaning. It literally means "going far, you shall not go far," which conveys the literal instruction "do not go very far" or "do not go far indeed." It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or a fixed phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from its literal components (unlike the examples provided for idioms such as "mouth of the sword"). Therefore, it is not classified as an idiom, hyperbole, or any other type of figurative language.\n\n5.  **"הַעְתִּ֖ירוּ בַּעֲדִֽי" (Plead, then, for me):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether Pharaoh\'s request to "plead for me" could be a figurative expression for seeking divine intervention on his behalf, or a manipulative plea.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct, literal request for intercessory prayer or supplication. The verb הַעְתִּ֖ירוּ (to entreat, supplicate) describes a literal action of prayer.

However, in this narrative context, it describes a straightforward action of Moses physically moving away. This is standard narrative language and not figurative.\n\n2.  **מֵעִ֣ם פַּרְעֹ֑ה (Pharaoh’s presence / from with Pharaoh):** I considered if "Pharaoh\'s presence" (as translated) or the literal Hebrew "from with Pharaoh" could be a form of metonymy or an idiom.\n    *   The Hebrew phrase מֵעִם פַּרְעֹה literally means "from with Pharaoh" or "from beside Pharaoh." It describes Moses\'s physical departure from Pharaoh\'s immediate vicinity or company.\n    *   While the English "Pharaoh\'s presence" might sometimes be used in a more abstract sense, the Hebrew here is a direct spatial description.

However, the instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "did" refers to an action and not a specific body part, it is to be understood literally within the ANE context. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"כִּדְבַ֣ר מֹשֶׁ֔ה" (as Moses asked):** I considered if this comparison of action ("as Moses asked") might be a simile. However, the instructions state, "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function, such as \'a prophet like myself\' (כָּמֹנִי) or \'a prophet like yourself\' (כָּמוֹךָ).

In ancient Near Eastern thought, and specifically in biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב/לֵבָב) is understood as the seat of intellect, will, emotion, and moral character, not merely a physical organ. Therefore, a literal physical "making heavy" of the heart is not the intended meaning.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion (as idiom, metaphor, and metonymy):**\n        *   **Idiom:** "To make heavy one\'s heart" (הִכְבִּיד לֵב) is a well-established biblical idiom for stubbornness, resistance, or an unwillingness to comply or change one\'s mind. The guidelines explicitly state that biblical idioms should be classified as "idiom."\n        *   **Metaphor:** The action of "making heavy" is a metaphorical description applied to Pharaoh\'s non-physical will or resolve. Heaviness here implies immovability, resistance, or difficulty in being swayed, which is a cross-domain comparison from the physical property of weight to a psychological state.\n        *   **Metonymy:** The term "heart" (לֵב) itself functions metonymically for Pharaoh\'s inner being, his will, his mind, or his disposition. The physical organ stands in for the psychological and volitional faculties.\n    *   **Borderline cases/Debate:** While clearly an idiom, the underlying mechanisms are metaphorical (making heavy = resistant) and metonymic (heart = will). The instructions allow for multiple classifications (e.g., both metaphor and idiom), so I have included all relevant types.\n\n2.  **"גַּ֖ם בַּפַּ֣עַם הַזֹּ֑את" (this time also):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this temporal phrase could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a straightforward, literal statement indicating a repeated occurrence.

While the "letting go" here refers to releasing from bondage, the verb itself is a standard term for release and is not used in a way that creates a cross-domain comparison or an opaque idiom.

In this context, Pharaoh is not physically grasping each Israelite. Instead, the physical act of "holding" is used to describe his continued political and social control over the Israelites, preventing their departure and keeping them in servitude. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison where a physical action (holding) is used to represent an abstract state of control or captivity. It is not a fixed, opaque idiom, but rather a transparent metaphorical extension of the verb\'s literal meaning. Therefore, it is classified as a metaphor.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It functions as a synecdoche, a type of metonymy, where a part (hand) represents the whole (God\'s active agency or power). The guidelines explicitly state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, it is both an idiom and a metonymy. The "hand" here is not a physical appendage but a symbol of divine action.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: The instruction regarding divine anthropomorphisms ("LITERAL... unless they refer to God\'s body") creates a slight ambiguity. However, the explicit instruction to mark biblical idioms as "idiom" type, combined with the common understanding of "hand of YHWH" as a non-literal expression of divine power, leads me to classify it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"הוֹיָ֗ה בְּמִקְנְךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּשָּׂדֶ֔ה בַּסּוּסִ֤ים בַּֽחֲמֹרִים֙ בַּגְּמַלִּ֔ים בַּבָּקָ֖ר וּבַצֹּ֑אן" (will strike your livestock in the fields—the horses, the asses, the camels, the cattle, and the sheep)**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the verb "הוֹיָה" (will strike/be upon) or the description of the livestock could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verb "הוֹיָה" (from הָיָה) is used here in a straightforward sense of "coming upon" or "happening to," describing the effect of God\'s power. The enumeration of livestock is a literal list of the animals that will be affected. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.\n\n3.  **"דֶּ֖בֶר כָּבֵ֥ד מְאֹֽד" (with a very severe pestilence)**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if "very severe pestilence" could be hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While "very severe" emphasizes the intensity, it is a literal description of the expected severity of the plague, not an exaggeration beyond what is literally possible or intended to be understood non-literally. It is a factual statement about the nature of the coming plague.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"To fix" or "to set" a time (שׂוּם מוֹעֵד) is a literal act of appointment or determination, indicating God\'s sovereignty and planning. It is a standard narrative description of divine agency.

It is a straightforward statement of fact emphasizing the complete preservation of the Israelite livestock, rather than a figurative representation of a part for the whole or an exaggeration. The English translation "not a head" is an idiomatic rendering in English, but the Hebrew itself is literal in its meaning of "not a single one."

In ancient Near Eastern thought, the `לֵב` (heart) was understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotions, not merely a physical organ. To describe the heart as "heavy" or "hard" (often translated as "stubborn" or "hardened") refers to a psychological or volitional state of obstinacy, resistance, and an unwillingness to yield or change one\'s mind. It does not imply a literal physical weight or condition of the organ. This is a clear instance of an idiom where a physical attribute (heaviness) is used to convey a non-physical, psychological disposition (stubbornness). Therefore, I am including this as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is treated as a literal statement of divine communication in this context.\n\n2.  **"קְח֤וּ לָכֶם֙ מְלֹ֣א חׇפְנֵיכֶ֔ם" (Each of you take handfuls):** I considered if "handfuls" (מְלֹ֣א חׇפְנֵיכֶ֔ם, literally "the fullness of your palms") could be a form of hyperbole or metonymy. However, it is a direct and literal instruction for the quantity of material to be taken, referring to the physical capacity of one\'s hands. There is no exaggeration or substitution of a related concept for the thing itself. Thus, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"פִּ֖יחַ כִּבְשָׁ֑ן" (soot from the kiln):** This is a straightforward, literal description of the substance Moses and Aaron are to take. No figurative elements were identified here.\n\n4.  **"וּזְרָק֥וֹ מֹשֶׁ֛ה הַשָּׁמַ֖יְמָה" (and let Moses throw it toward the sky):** This describes a literal action of throwing a substance upwards. No figurative language is present.\n\n5.  **"לְעֵינֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה" (in the sight of Pharaoh):** I considered if this phrase is a literal description of seeing or an idiom. The phrase "לְעֵינֵי" (literally "to the eyes of") is a very common biblical idiom meaning "in the presence of," "before," or "in full view of." While it involves the physical act of seeing, its primary function here is to emphasize public witnessing and direct observation by Pharaoh, rather than merely the physiological process of sight. The guidelines state: "Biblical idions and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This fits the definition of a biblical idiom. Therefore, I have marked it as figurative.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"God\'s hand" refers to God\'s body.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While it involves a body part, the phrase "to stretch forth the hand" (שָׁלַח יָד) is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew. It consistently functions as a metonymy where the "hand" stands for the power, authority, or action of the agent. In this context, it signifies God\'s immediate and decisive power to inflict judgment or bring about a specific outcome, rather than a literal physical extension of a limb. The emphasis is on the *exercise of power* that the hand represents.

While it describes a severe and complete outcome, it is a literal statement of total destruction or disappearance from existence on earth. It is not a comparison to something else, nor an exaggeration beyond the literal possibility of complete annihilation in a historical context (e.g., a people being wiped out).\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The English translation "thwart" or "exalt yourself over" suggests a strong, defiant action.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** While "exalting oneself over" can certainly imply arrogance, defiance, or oppression, it is not a cross-domain comparison. The Hithpael form of סלל describes a reflexive or intensive action of making oneself high or prominent, which in this context is directed *against* God\'s people. It describes a specific type of behavior and attitude—one of high-handedness, defiance, and oppression—rather than likening the oppressor\'s actions to something else entirely.

The instruction to be conservative with character actions and dialogue, and to not mark proportional or behavioral comparisons as figurative, supports this exclusion.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was a borderline case because the nuance of "exalting oneself over" can be quite strong and evocative, almost *feeling* metaphorical. However, strictly adhering to the definition of a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons" and the conservative guidelines for character actions, it falls short of being a metaphor. It describes *what* the character is doing and *how* they are doing it, rather than comparing their action to something from a different domain.\n\n2.  **"בְּעַמִּ֑י" (My people):**\n    *   **Considered:** This is a direct reference to the Israelites.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal designation for the group of people.

According to the provided guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body parts.

While the heaviness implies severity, the primary meaning is physical. The intensifier "מְאֹד" simply emphasizes the degree of this physical heaviness. It does not create an impossible or clearly exaggerated scenario that would qualify as hyperbole.

While it uses a comparative particle (כָמֹהוּ, "like it"), the overall statement functions as an emphatic declaration of an absolute superlative degree. Such "never before, never again" statements are common in biblical narrative, particularly when describing divine judgments or extraordinary events (e.g., other plagues). These are rhetorical exaggerations designed to underscore the extreme magnitude, uniqueness, and impact of the event, rather than to provide a strictly verifiable historical claim. The purpose is to emphasize the unparalleled nature of God\'s judgment and the severity of the impending event.

Applying this verb to "fire," an inanimate natural phenomenon, attributes a human-like capacity for locomotion and progression to it. This is a clear instance of personification, giving fire the ability to "walk" or "go" down to the ground.

The preceding verse (Exodus 9:23) explicitly states "fire ran down to the earth" (וְאֵשׁ מִתְהַלֶּכֶת אָרְצָה) in conjunction with the hail, strongly suggesting lightning. Therefore, "fire" here is a clear cross-domain comparison, using the concept of combustion fire (vehicle) to describe lightning (target) based on their shared visual and destructive qualities (ground).

While it conveys an extraordinary event, the narrative presents it as a factual, historical claim within its own framework.

I considered if "human and beast" was a figurative way to represent "all living things."\n    *   Reasoning: "Human and beast" (אָדָם וְעַד־בְּהֵמָה) is a common merism in Hebrew, used to denote comprehensive categories of living beings. It is a literal enumeration of the primary categories of life affected, not a figurative comparison or substitution. "All that were in the open" (כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּשָּׂדֶ֔ה) is a literal description of location.\n    *   Conclusion: Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְאֵ֨ת כׇּל־עֵ֤שֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה֙ הִכָּ֣ה הַבָּרָ֔ד / the hail also struck down all the grasses of the field**:\n    *   Considered: Personification for "struck down" (הִכָּה).\n    *   Reasoning: As with the initial analysis of "struck down," this describes the direct physical damage inflicted by the hail on the vegetation.

While Moses will indeed perform the physical action of spreading his hands, in the biblical and ANE context, this gesture is a well-established conventional signifier for the act of prayer, supplication, or intercession to God. The physical gesture (spreading hands) stands in for the broader, more abstract act of prayer. Therefore, it functions as both an idiom (a set phrase with a conventional meaning beyond its literal parts) and metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part of the action or a physical manifestation represents the whole spiritual act). This is a borderline case because the physical action is literal, but its *meaning* and *purpose* are conventionally understood to represent something more.

If "face" were taken literally as a physical body part, it would be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion as an idiom:** However, the phrase "מִפְּנֵי" (mippəney) functions as a compound preposition meaning "from before," "in the presence of," "because of," or "from." When combined with the verb "ירא" (to fear), "ירא מִפְּנֵי" is a very common and well-established biblical idiom meaning "to fear God," "to revere God," or "to be in awe of God\'s presence/authority." The emphasis is not on a literal physical face, but on the source or object of the fear/reverence, which is God\'s being, presence, or authority. The instructions explicitly state that "biblical idioms and set phrases (e.g. ... פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה)" should be classified as "idiom" type. While the example given is "face of the ground," the structure "פְּנֵי X" as a set phrase or idiom is consistent. Therefore, "מִפְּנֵי יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהִֽים" is best classified as an idiom, conveying the concept of fearing/revering God\'s presence or authority, rather than a literal physical face.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** The distinction between a figurative anthropomorphism (referring to a body part) and an idiom can be subtle. However, the conventional usage of "ירא מִפְּנֵי" as a fixed expression for "fear God" strongly supports its classification as an idiom, where the meaning is conventionalized and not primarily dependent on a literal interpretation of "face."', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

When referring to thunder, it is common to use "קול רעם" (kol ra\'am, "sound/voice of thunder") or simply "קולות" (sounds/voices) in context, as it is the most prominent auditory aspect of a thunderstorm.

Describing the heart as "heavy" or "hardened" is not a literal physical change to the organ but a metaphorical way to express a psychological state of stubbornness, resistance, or unyieldingness.

"God said" is a standard action and does not refer to a specific body part in a non-literal way. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **בֹּ֖א אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה** (Go to Pharaoh)\n    *   Considered: Standard command.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal instruction for Moses to physically go to Pharaoh. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **כִּֽי־אֲנִ֞י הִכְבַּ֤דְתִּי אֶת־לִבּוֹ֙** (For I have hardened his heart)\n    *   Considered: If "hardened his heart" (הִכְבַּדְתִּי אֶת־לִבּוֹ) is a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase "hardened his heart" is a well-established biblical idiom. The verb כבד (kaved) in the Hiphil means "to make heavy" or "to make hard." When applied to the "heart" (לֵב), which in ancient Hebrew thought is the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, it signifies making someone obstinate, stubborn, or unresponsive to divine commands or persuasion. This is not a literal physical hardening of the organ but a figurative description of a psychological and volitional state. As per instructions, biblical idioms are classified as "idiom."\n    *   Borderline cases: While it functions primarily as an idiom, one could also argue for a metonymic aspect where the "heart" stands for the will or inner disposition, and a metaphorical aspect where "heaviness" or "hardness" describes resistance. However, its frequent and conventional use as a fixed expression makes "idiom" the most appropriate and encompassing classification according to the provided guidelines. This phrase is marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **וְאֶת־לֵ֣ב עֲבָדָ֔יו** (and the hearts of his courtiers)\n    *   Considered: If "hearts of his courtiers" (לֵ֣ב עֲבָדָ֔יו) in conjunction with the implied "hardened" (from the preceding clause) is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a direct extension of the idiom discussed above. The "hearts" (לֵב) of the courtiers are also made heavy/hard, meaning their collective will or disposition is rendered stubborn and resistant. It carries the same idiomatic meaning as applied to Pharaoh\'s heart. This phrase is marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **לְמַ֗עַן שִׁתִ֛י אֹתֹתַ֥י אֵ֖לֶּה בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ** (in order that I may display these My signs among them)\n    *   Considered: If "display these My signs among them" contains any figurative language.\n    *   Reasoning: "Display signs" (שִׁתִ֛י אֹתֹתַ֥י) refers to the literal performance of miraculous acts. "Among them" (בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ) is a literal spatial description. No figurative language is present here.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Reasoning: This is a literal description of physical movement and a direct encounter between individuals. It is standard narrative language and not figurative.\n2.  **וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗יו** (and said to him): I considered if "said" could be figurative, such as speaking for someone else in a metaphorical sense. Reasoning: This is a literal act of verbal communication. It is standard narrative language and not figurative.\n3.  **כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽעִבְרִ֔ים** (Thus says יהוה, the God of the Hebrews): I considered if "says" or "God of the Hebrews" could be figurative.

Neither is figurative.\n4.  **עַד־מָתַ֣י מֵאַ֔נְתָּ לֵעָנֹ֖ת** (How long will you refuse to humble yourself): I considered if "refuse" or "humble yourself" could be figurative.

They are not cross-domain comparisons or personifications.\n5.  **מִפָּנָ֑י** (mippānāy - before Me / from My face): I considered if this phrase, literally "from my face" or "before my face," is a literal reference to God\'s physical face or an idiom. Reasoning: While "פָּנִים" (panim - face) is a body part, the construction "מִפָּנָ֑י" (mippānāy) is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "in my presence" or "before me." It refers to God\'s authoritative presence rather than a visible, physical facial feature. This aligns with the instruction to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom." It is not a literal anthropomorphism of a visible face, but an idiomatic expression of presence and authority. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n6.  **שַׁלַּ֥ח עַמִּ֖י** (Let My people go): I considered if "let go" could be figurative, such as releasing from a metaphorical bondage. Reasoning: This is a literal command for Pharaoh to release the Israelite people from physical servitude. It is not figurative.\n7.  **וְיַֽעַבְדֻֽנִי** (that they may worship Me): I considered if "worship" could be figurative. Reasoning: This is a literal act of religious service and devotion. It is not figurative.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "מִפָּנָ֑י" is identified as figurative language (an idiom).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

There is no metaphorical or symbolic meaning intended; it describes a straightforward human decision and its consequence.\n- **"אֶת־עַמִּ֑י" (My people)**: I considered if the possessive "My" (referring to God\'s relationship with the Israelites) could be figurative. This phrase literally denotes God\'s chosen people and His direct relationship with them, not a metaphorical comparison or an idiom.\n- **"הִנְנִ֨י מֵבִ֥יא" (I will bring)**: I considered if this divine action, "I will bring," should be marked as a figurative anthropomorphism.

It is commonly used idiomatically to refer to the "surface" or "face" of something, especially in phrases like `עֵין הָאָרֶץ` (surface of the land) or `עֵין הַמַּיִם` (spring of water, lit. "eye of water"). This is a well-established biblical idiom, not a literal personification of the land having an eye. The locusts cover the visible surface, not a literal eye.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as an idiom.\n\n2.  **Phrase:** `וְלֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ` (so that no one will be able to see the land)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this might be hyperbole, implying an impossible degree of covering.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Given the immense swarms of locusts described in Exodus, their density can indeed be so great as to obscure the ground and even the sky. This is a literal description of the physical effect of a severe locust plague, not an exaggeration.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **Phrase:** `וְאָכַ֣ל׀ אֶת־יֶ֣תֶר הַפְּלֵטָ֗ה הַנִּשְׁאֶ֤רֶת לָכֶם֙ מִן־הַבָּרָ֔ד` (They shall devour the surviving remnant that was left to you after the hail)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "devour" (וְאָכַל) might be a strong verb used hyperbolically.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "devour" is a strong verb, it accurately describes the eating habits of locusts, which consume vegetation rapidly and thoroughly. The phrase describes a literal action of the locusts.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **Phrase:** `וְאָכַל֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעֵ֔ץ הַצֹּמֵ֥חַ לָכֶ֖ם מִן־הַשָּׂדֶֽה` (and they shall eat away all your trees that grow in the field)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "all your trees" (כׇּל־הָעֵץ) might be hyperbole, suggesting every single tree without exception.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In the context of a devastating locust plague, "all" can refer to the entirety of the available vegetation or every *kind* of tree, or simply a comprehensive destruction that leaves virtually nothing. Locusts are known to strip trees bare, leaving nothing but bark. Given the conservative instruction for narrative text, this is best understood as a literal description of the widespread and thorough destruction, rather than an exaggeration.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This sweeping totality is an exaggeration (hyperbole) used to emphasize the overwhelming and inescapable nature of the impending plague, rather than a precise, verifiable claim about every single dwelling. It serves to convey the severity and pervasiveness of the plague in a dramatic way.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was borderline between a literal description of an extreme event and hyperbole. I decided on hyperbole due to the emphatic and universal scope implied by "all," which is characteristic of exaggeration for dramatic effect in warnings of this nature.\n\n2.  **"אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־רָא֤וּ אֲבֹתֶ֙יךָ֙ וַאֲב֣וֹת אֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ מִיּ֗וֹם הֱיוֹתָם֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה עַ֖ד הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה" (something that neither your fathers nor fathers’ fathers have seen from the day they appeared on earth to this day)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this phrase was a literal historical claim, an idiom, or hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a common biblical idiom used to express the unprecedented nature or unparalleled severity of an event. The phrase "neither your fathers nor fathers\' fathers have seen" combined with the vast temporal scope "from the day they appeared on earth to this day" is a sweeping statement that is highly unlikely to be literally true in a precise historical sense. Instead, it functions as an exaggeration (hyperbole) to dramatically emphasize that the impending plague will be unique and more severe than any previously experienced event. Therefore, it is both an idiom and hyperbole.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I debated whether to classify it solely as an idiom or also as hyperbole. Given that the idiom achieves its meaning of "unprecedented" through an exaggerated claim about historical scope, it fits the definition of hyperbole as well. The instructions allow for multiple classifications.\n\n3.  **"מִיּ֗וֹם הֱיוֹתָם֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה" (from the day they appeared on earth)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "appeared on earth" was figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard temporal marker referring to the beginning of human existence or a people\'s presence in a land. It is a literal description of their presence, not a figurative one. While it is part of the larger idiom discussed above, in isolation, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"וַיִּ֥פֶן וַיֵּצֵ֖א מֵעִ֥ם פַּרְעֹֽה" (With that he turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this description of Moses\'s actions was figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward, literal description of Moses\'s physical actions.

Here, "this one" (זֶה), referring to Moses and the ongoing situation with the plagues, is directly equated with a snare. The situation is not a literal physical trap, but it is described as functioning like one, causing entrapment, difficulty, and danger for Pharaoh and his courtiers. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where an abstract problem is likened to a concrete object, making it a metaphor.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** None; this is a straightforward metaphor.\n\n2.  **"Let a delegation go to worship their God יהוה !"

It is a literal reference to a specific group of people. The phrase itself is a direct command and statement of purpose, devoid of figurative comparison or personification.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** None.\n\n3.  **"Are you not yet aware that Egypt is lost?" (הֲטֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered whether "Egypt is lost" (אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם) is personification, an idiom, or hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The verb אָבְדָה (*avadah*) means "perished," "was lost," or "was destroyed." While physical objects can be destroyed and people can perish, a nation (מִצְרָֽיִם, *Mitsrayim*) cannot literally "perish" or "be lost" in the same way a living being dies or an object is misplaced. Instead, it refers to the utter ruin, collapse, and demise of its societal, economic, and political structures. Attributing this state of "being lost" or "perished" to the entire nation as a unified entity is a form of personification, treating the non-human entity (Egypt) as if it were a living being or a valuable possession that can suffer such a comprehensive and existential loss. It describes the nation\'s overall state of ruin rather than merely a collection of destroyed elements. The instruction explicitly states to mark "Personification of non-human entities."\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** I considered if this might be classified as an idiom for "utter ruin" or hyperbole. However, the attribution of a state of "being lost/perished" to the nation as a singular, unified entity, rather than just describing the destruction of its components, leans more strongly towards personification. The nation is treated as an entity capable of experiencing this profound state of demise.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

By mentioning both the "young" (or "underlings") and the "old" (or "elders"), Moses is not literally referring only to these two groups, but rather to the *entire* community, from the lowest to the highest social station or from the youngest to the oldest age.

Not figurative.\n*   **"כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר אֲשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶתְכֶ֖ם וְאֶֽת־טַפְּכֶ֑ם"** (the same as I mean to let your dependents go with you!): Considered if this is figurative (e.g., a veiled threat or ironic statement).

Not figurative.\n*   **"רְא֕וּ"** (Clearly / See!): Considered if this is figurative (e.g., a metaphorical "seeing" of truth or understanding). Reasoning: While "seeing" can be metaphorical for understanding, in this context, it\'s an imperative to pay attention to what follows, which Pharaoh presents as a clear observation. It functions as a literal command to perceive.

Not personification.\n    *   Considered if "נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵיכֶֽם" (before your faces) is a literal spatial description. Reasoning: While it literally means "before your faces," the combination "רָעָה נֶגֶד פְּנֵיכֶֽם" is not meant to be understood as a physical object ("evil") literally placed in front of their physical faces. Instead, it conveys the idea of evil intent, malicious purpose, or a dangerous outcome that is evident or planned by them.\n    *   Considered if "פְּנֵיכֶֽם" (your faces) is a metonymy for the person or their intention. Reasoning: Yes, "face" (פנים) often stands for the person, presence, or intention in Hebrew. In this specific idiom, the "face" represents the direction, intention, or visible aspect of their purpose. However, the primary classification should be the idiom itself.\n    *   Considered if the entire phrase "רָעָה נֶגֶד פְּנֵיכֶֽם" is an idiom. Reasoning: This phrase is a well-established idiom in biblical Hebrew (e.g., also in Gen 44:4, 1 Sam 29:10) meaning "evil is your intention," "you have evil in mind," or "mischief is evident in your purpose/direction." The English translation "you are bent on mischief" captures this idiomatic sense. The instructions state to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

There is no hidden meaning, metaphor, or idiom present.\n\n2.  **לְכֽוּ־נָ֤א הַגְּבָרִים֙** (You gentlemen go / Go now, men): I considered if this command could be figurative, perhaps a sarcastic dismissal. However, in the narrative context, it functions as a literal imperative from Pharaoh, instructing Moses and Aaron to leave. While the tone might be dismissive, the language itself is direct and literal.\n\n3.  **וְעִבְד֣וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֔ה** (and worship יהוה): I considered if "worship" could be used in a non-literal sense.

There is no figurative meaning intended.\n\n4.  **כִּ֥י אֹתָ֖הּ אַתֶּ֣ם מְבַקְשִׁ֑ים** (since that is what you want / for that you seek): I considered if this statement of motivation might be figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that it is a straightforward, literal statement by Pharaoh, attributing a desire to Moses and Aaron. It functions as a direct explanation for his command.\n\n5.  **וַיְגָ֣רֶשׁ אֹתָ֔ם** (And he expelled them): I considered if "expelled" could be figurative, perhaps meaning a strong verbal dismissal rather than physical removal. My reasoning for excluding it is that the verb "גרש" (garash) literally means to drive out or expel. In this narrative, it describes a literal action of Pharaoh removing Moses and Aaron from his presence.\n\n6.  **מֵאֵ֖ת פְּנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה** (from Pharaoh’s presence / from the face of Pharaoh): I considered this phrase carefully. While "פְּנֵי" (penei) literally means "face of," the construction "מֵאֵת פְּנֵי X" is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "from the presence of X" or "from before X." It does not refer to being removed from Pharaoh\'s physical face, but rather from his immediate vicinity, court, or sphere of authority. This is a clear instance of metonymy, where a part (face) stands for the whole (the person\'s presence or authority). This falls under the guideline to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type.

There is no indication of a hidden meaning, cross-domain comparison, or set idiomatic phrase. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"וַֽיהֹוָ֗ה נִהַ֤ג רֽוּחַ־קָדִים֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ" (and יהוה drove an east wind over the land):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "יהוה נִהַ֤ג" (יהוה drove) constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The verb נהג (nahag), meaning "drove" or "guided," describes an action attributed to God. Since it does not refer to a specific body part of God, according to the guidelines, this anthropomorphism is to be considered literal within the ANE context. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **"כׇּל־הַיּ֥וֹם הַה֖וּא וְכׇל־הַלָּ֑יְלָה" (all that day and all night):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether this phrase could be hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal description of duration, indicating a continuous period. While "all day and all night" can sometimes be used hyperbolically in other contexts, here it serves to emphasize the continuous nature of the wind, which is a literal possibility.

While "bringing" can be a human action, winds are a natural force known to physically transport objects, including large swarms of insects like locusts, over significant distances. Describing the wind as "bringing" the locusts is a literal and accurate description of its physical effect and agency in their transport, rather than attributing human-like intention, consciousness, or other exclusive human qualities to the wind. It is a common and literal way to describe the wind\'s function in the natural world.

In the context of a locust plague, it describes the physical movement of the locusts into and over the land. While "invaded" in English can carry military connotations, the Hebrew verb here is a standard, literal description of the locusts\' arrival and spread. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיָּ֕נַח בְּכֹ֖ל גְּב֣וּל מִצְרָ֑יִם** (and settled within all the territory of Egypt)\n    *   Considered: Whether the verb וַיָּ֕נַח (vayyanach, "rested" or "settled down") is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal description of the locusts landing and remaining in the territory.

Here, it literally describes the immense number and density of the locusts, indicating an overwhelming presence. It is a direct description of their physical characteristic as a collective mass, not a cross-domain comparison or other figurative device. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **לְ֠פָנָ֠יו לֹא־הָ֨יָה כֵ֤ן אַרְבֶּה֙ כָּמֹ֔הוּ וְאַחֲרָ֖יו לֹ֥א יִֽהְיֶה־כֵּֽן** (never before had there been so many, nor will there ever be so many again.)\n    *   Considered: Whether this absolute statement about the unprecedented and unrepeatable nature of the locust plague constitutes hyperbole.\n    *   Reasoning: This declaration asserts that this particular locust plague was unique in history, both before and after. Such absolute, all-encompassing statements ("never before... nor will there ever be again") are a common rhetorical device in biblical narrative. Their primary function is to emphasize the extraordinary magnitude, severity, and uniqueness of an event, rather than to provide a strictly verifiable historical claim. By exaggerating the unparalleled nature of the plague, the narrator underscores its profound impact and the divine power behind it. This use of exaggeration for emphasis aligns with the definition of hyperbole. Despite the instruction to be conservative, hyperbole is a distinct form of figurative language, and this phrase clearly functions to amplify the impact beyond a mere factual report.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Instead, "eye of the land" is a well-established Hebrew idiom (similar to "face of the earth" - פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה, which is explicitly mentioned as an idiom in the instructions) referring to the visible surface or appearance of the land. The locusts covered this visible surface so completely that it was hidden from view. This is a form of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part, the "eye" or visible aspect, stands for the whole visible surface), but given the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, this phrase fits that category best due to its conventional usage.\n    *   **Decision**: Mark as Idiom.\n\n2.  **"וַתֶּחְשַׁ֣ךְ הָאָ֒רֶץ֒" (and the land was darkened)**\n    *   **Considered**: If this is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a literal description of the effect of an immense swarm of locusts.

When a human requests God to "carry" their sin, it signifies a plea for the removal of the burden of guilt and the consequences of the offense, effectively meaning "forgive my sin."

Here, "death" (הַמָּוֶת) is used to refer not merely to the state of being dead, but to the *plague itself* that is causing death. It is an instance of metonymy where the effect (death) stands for the cause (the plague/calamity). Pharaoh is requesting the removal of the destructive force, not the abstract concept of death from existence.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** While one could argue it\'s a very direct reference to the *event* of dying, the more precise understanding in the context of plagues is that "death" refers to the *agent* or *cause* of death, making it a clear case of metonymy (effect for cause).\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n4.  **`אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה` (with יהוה):** I considered if "pleading with Yahweh" implies a physical interaction, making it anthropomorphic and thus potentially figurative.

This gives darkness a tangible, physical presence that it does not literally possess, akin to a physical object. This attributes a human-like sensory interaction to a non-human entity.\n    *   **Hyperbole**: The description exaggerates the intensity and density of the darkness to such an extreme degree that it is presented as physically palpable. This exaggeration emphasizes the profound, oppressive, and supernatural nature of the plague.\n    *   **Borderline Cases**: I debated whether to classify this solely as hyperbole or also as personification. I concluded that the hyperbole is achieved *through* the personification of darkness as a tangible entity. The exaggeration of the darkness\'s density is conveyed by attributing to it the quality of being touchable, which is a form of personification.

Instead, it signifies providing for their use, entrusting them with the means, or making the sacrifices available for their possession and control so they can perform the ritual.

It is literal.\n\n2.  **לֵ֣ךְ מֵעָלָ֑י** (Be gone from me! / Go from upon me): I considered if "מֵעָלָ֑י" (from upon me) might be figurative. However, "מֵעַל" is a common Hebrew preposition meaning "from above," "from upon," or "away from." In this context, it literally means to depart from Pharaoh\'s immediate vicinity or presence. It is a direct command for physical departure and is not figurative.\n\n3.  **הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֗** (Take care / Guard yourself): This is a literal command to be cautious or to protect oneself. It is not figurative.\n\n4.  **אַל־תֹּ֙סֶף֙** (do not add / again): I considered this phrase. While literally meaning "do not add," when followed by an infinitive (as it is here with "רְא֣וֹת"), it functions as a well-established biblical idiom meaning "do not do X again" or "never again do X." The instruction explicitly states to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, I am marking this as an idiom.\n    *   *Reasoning for Target/Vehicle/Ground:* The target is the future action of seeing Pharaoh. The vehicle is the concept of "adding" or repeating an action. The ground is the prohibition of continuation or repetition.\n\n5.  **רְא֣וֹת פָּנַ֔י** (to see my face): I considered this phrase carefully. While "face" (פָּנִים) is a physical body part, "to see someone\'s face" is a common biblical idiom and metonymy for being in someone\'s presence, having an audience with them, or encountering them. The "face" (a part) stands for the whole person or their presence. This is particularly true in formal or royal contexts. The instruction specifies that synecdoche is a type of metonymy and that biblical idioms should be classified. Therefore, I am marking this as both an idiom and metonymy.\n\n6.  **כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם רְאֹתְךָ֥ פָנַ֖י** (for the moment you look upon my face / in the day of your seeing my face): This repeats the phrase "רְאֹתְךָ֥ פָנַ֖י" (your seeing my face). My reasoning is identical to point 5. It is an idiom and metonymy where "face" represents Pharaoh\'s presence or person.\n\n7.  **תָּמֽוּת** (you shall die): This is a literal statement of consequence – physical death. It is not figurative.\n\nIn summary, the figurative elements identified are the idiom "אַל־תֹּ֙סֶף֙" for "never again" and the metonymic idiom "רְא֣וֹת פָּנַ֔י" / "רְאֹתְךָ֥ פָנַ֖י" where "face" stands for the person\'s presence.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"God said" refers to an action of communication, not a physical body part.

The plague literally affects Pharaoh (his family, his person) and Egypt (its people, its land). Given the instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Standard narrative language" and to only mark "clear metaphors," "personification," or "obvious similes," this phrase does not meet the threshold for being marked as figurative.

I also considered if it is a standard idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While one could analyze "giving favor" as a conceptual metaphor (treating an abstract quality as a transferable object), it is a very common and conventional expression in Biblical Hebrew for "to grant goodwill," "to dispose favorably," or "to show kindness." As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase functions as a set phrase or idiom for granting acceptance or goodwill, rather than a novel cross-domain comparison.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as an idiom.\n\n2.  **"בְּעֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם" (in the eyes of Egypt)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase is a literal reference to physical eyes, a metonymy, or a standard idiom. I also considered the use of "Egypt" as metonymy for "Egyptians."\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a classic and extremely common idiom in Biblical Hebrew, meaning "in the opinion/estimation of" or "in the sight of." It does not refer to the literal physical eyes but to perception, judgment, or regard. Therefore, "eyes" functions metonymically for the faculty of perception. Additionally, "Egypt" (מִצְרָ֑יִם) is a metonymy for "the Egyptians" (the people of Egypt). Since the instructions state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and allow for multiple types, it is classified as both an idiom and metonymy.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as both idiom and metonymy.\n\n3.  **"הָאִ֣ישׁ מֹשֶׁ֗ה" (the man Moses)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase, particularly "the man Moses," carries any figurative meaning beyond a literal identification, especially given the English note.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "the man Moses" is a literal identifier. The English note clarifies a semantic nuance about its function in the narrative ("the participant whose involvement defines the depicted situation") but does not suggest a figurative meaning like metaphor or simile. It is a straightforward way to refer to Moses.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **"גָּד֤וֹל מְאֹד֙" (much esteemed / great very)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "great" (גָּד֤וֹל) when referring to a person\'s status or esteem, is a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "great" can refer to physical size, in the context of a person\'s standing, it is a standard and literal descriptor of high status, importance, or esteem. This is a common usage in both Hebrew and English and is not considered a cross-domain comparison that would qualify as a metaphor.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"בְּעֵינֵ֥י עַבְדֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה" (in the eyes of Pharaoh\'s servants)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase is a literal reference to physical eyes, a metonymy, or a standard idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is identical in structure and meaning to "in the eyes of Egypt" discussed above. It is a common idiom meaning "in the opinion/estimation of Pharaoh\'s servants," where "eyes" functions metonymically for perception.\n    *   **Decision:** Classified as both idiom and metonymy.\n\n6.  **"וּבְעֵינֵ֥י הָעָֽם" (and in the eyes of the people)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase is a literal reference to physical eyes, a metonymy, or a standard idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is identical in structure and meaning to the previous instances of "in the eyes of X."

My reasoning is based directly on the instruction: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "go forth" is an action and does not refer to a specific body part of God, it is to be interpreted literally as God\'s direct intervention or presence, consistent with the ANE understanding provided.\n5.  **"בְּת֥וֹךְ מִצְרָֽיִם" (among the Egyptians):** I considered if the prepositional phrase "among" or "in the midst of" could be used figuratively.

"Land of Egypt" is a literal geographical entity. This is standard narrative language describing a future event. I found no figurative elements here.\n\n2.  **"מִבְּכ֤וֹר פַּרְעֹה֙ הַיֹּשֵׁ֣ב עַל־כִּסְא֔וֹ" (from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits on his throne):** I considered if "throne" (כִּסְא֔וֹ) or "sits on his throne" (הַיֹּשֵׁ֣ב עַל־כִּסְא֔וֹ) might be metonymy for royal power or authority. While a throne is a symbol of power, the phrase "who sits on his throne" is a literal description of Pharaoh\'s physical position and status as a reigning monarch. It serves to identify *which* Pharaoh (the current, reigning one) and to establish the highest social stratum affected by the plague. It is a concrete, descriptive detail rather than a substitution for the abstract concept of power itself. Therefore, I did not mark it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"עַ֚ד בְּכ֣וֹר הַשִּׁפְחָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר אַחַ֣ר הָרֵחָ֑יִם" (to the first-born of the slave girl who is behind the millstones):** I considered if "behind the millstones" (אַחַ֣ר הָרֵחָ֑יִם) could be metonymy for low social status or arduous labor. Grinding at the millstones was indeed a task typically performed by the lowest servants, often women, and was physically demanding. However, the phrase literally describes the slave girl\'s physical location and activity. It is a concrete detail used to illustrate the lowest social stratum affected by the plague, completing the spectrum from the highest (Pharaoh) to the lowest (slave girl). It describes a person *who has* low status by detailing her typical activity and location, rather than substituting the activity for the abstract concept of low status. This was a borderline case, but given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and descriptions of character actions, I concluded it is a literal, descriptive detail rather than a clear figurative substitution.\n\n4.  **"וְכֹ֖ל בְּכ֥וֹר בְּהֵמָֽה" (and all the first-born of the cattle):** This is a literal statement extending the scope of the plague to animals. I found no figurative elements here.\n\nIn summary, the entire verse uses highly descriptive, literal language to convey the comprehensive and devastating scope of the plague, affecting all strata of society and even animals. There are no clear metaphors, similes, personifications, or biblical idioms present. The potential metonymies were ultimately classified as literal descriptions that *imply* status rather than *substitute* for it, adhering to the conservative guidelines.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The purpose of this statement is not to provide a precise historical or future prediction, but rather to emphasize the extreme intensity, severity, and unprecedented magnitude of the event. It highlights the unparalleled nature of the divine judgment, making it a strong rhetorical device. This is a definite case of hyperbole.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

So, a literal interpretation of "move its tongue" is possible.\n    *   **Considered if personification:** I considered if "snarl his tongue" or "move his tongue" implied a human-like speech or action from the dog. However, dogs naturally make sounds and aggressive gestures, so attributing such an action to a dog is not personification in this context.\n    *   **Considered if idiom:** The phrase "חָרַץ לָשׁוֹן" (charatz lashon) is a recognized Hebrew idiom. While it literally means "to sharpen/move the tongue," it functions idiomatically to mean "to utter a sound," "to speak against," or "to make an aggressive sound/gesture." In this context, it signifies that no dog will make *any* sound or aggressive move against the Israelites. The guideline explicitly states that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, despite the literal possibility of a dog moving its tongue, the phrase itself is a fixed expression conveying a broader, non-literal meaning of making a hostile sound or gesture. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n\n3.  **"לְמֵאִ֖ישׁ וְעַד־בְּהֵמָ֑ה" (at human or beast):** This phrase was considered for any figurative meaning. It is a literal and comprehensive statement referring to all living beings, from humans to animals. No figurative language is present.\n\n4.  **"לְמַ֙עַן֙ תֵּֽדְע֔וּן אֲשֶׁר֙ יַפְלֶ֣ה יְהֹוָ֔ה בֵּ֥ין מִצְרַ֖יִם וּבֵ֥ין יִשְׂרָאֵֽל" (in order that you may know that יהוה makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel):** This phrase was considered for any figurative meaning. "Makes a distinction" (יַפְלֶה) is a literal action of God, indicating a clear separation or differentiation. No figurative language is present.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only the phrase "לֹ֤א יֶֽחֱרַץ־כֶּ֙לֶב֙ לְשֹׁנ֔וֹ" is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Reasoning: In biblical narrative, "coming down" often refers to a literal physical movement, either from a higher elevation or simply moving from one location to another to enter someone\'s presence. There is no contextual indication here that it is anything other than a literal physical movement. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **"and bow low to me" (וְהִשְׁתַּֽחֲווּ־לִ֣י)**: I considered if "bow low" could be a figurative expression for submission without the physical act. Reasoning: This is a standard physical action of deference and submission in the Ancient Near East. It is a literal description of an action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **"Depart, you and all the people" (צֵ֤א אַתָּה֙ וְכׇל־הָעָ֣ם)**: This is a direct command. Reasoning: It is a literal statement of instruction. Not figurative.\n*   **"who follow you!" (אֲשֶׁר־בְּרַגְלֶ֔יךָ / lit. "who are at your feet")**: I considered if "at your feet" (בְּרַגְלֶ֔יךָ) was a literal physical position or a figurative expression. Reasoning: While literally meaning "at your feet," the context clearly indicates followers, dependents, or those under one\'s command/leadership, rather than people physically positioned directly at Moses\'s feet. This is a well-established biblical idiom for subordinates or followers. It is a set phrase where the meaning is understood beyond the literal spatial relationship. This is a figurative idiom.\n*   **"After that I will depart." (וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵ֖ן אֵצֵ֑א)**: This is a literal statement of intent. Reasoning: It is a literal description of a future action.

(בׇּחֳרִי־אָֽף)**: I considered if "hot" (חֳרִי) was a literal description of anger\'s temperature or a metaphorical description of its intensity. Reasoning: Anger itself does not possess a literal temperature. The Hebrew חֳרִי (ḥori, "burning" or "heat") is used here to describe the *intensity* and *nature* of the emotion אָף (ʾaf, "anger"). This is a cross-domain comparison, likening an abstract emotion to a physical sensation (heat/burning). While it is a very common and almost conventionalized expression in Hebrew, it originates from a metaphorical understanding.

This is a conventionalized expression where the physical act of hearing stands for the mental and volitional act of compliance. The guidelines instruct to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type. This usage of שמע is a well-established idiom for expressing obedience or disobedience. It is not a literal statement about Pharaoh\'s auditory capabilities, but about his refusal to comply with Moses\' message.\n    *   Borderline case: While one could argue it\'s a semantic extension rather than a strict idiom, its conventionalized nature and the instruction to mark "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" make it appropriate to classify it as such.\n\n3.  **לְמַ֛עַן רְב֥וֹת מוֹפְתַ֖י** (in order that My marvels may be multiplied)\n    *   Considered: If "marvels" (מוֹפְתַי) or "multiplied" (רבות) contain figurative language.\n    *   Reasoning: "Marvels" refers to literal signs and wonders performed by God. "Multiplied" refers to a literal increase in the number of these signs. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.

Therefore, "the house" stands in for "the people of the house." This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where the container stands for the contained).

However, in the context of sacrificial animals, "without blemish" refers to a literal physical requirement—the animal must be physically perfect, without defect or injury, to be acceptable for sacrifice.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"זָכָ֥ר בֶּן־שָׁנָ֖ה" (a yearling male):** I considered if the specific age and gender description could be symbolic or figurative in some way.

However, in the context of the Passover lamb, this is a literal instruction to guard and care for the animal until the designated time. There is no cross-domain comparison or personification. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"עַ֣ד אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָׂ֛ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֑ה" (until the fourteenth day of this month):** I considered if the temporal markers "day" or "month" could be used figuratively.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"כֹּ֛ל קְהַ֥ל עֲדַֽת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל" (all the assembled congregation of the Israelites):** I considered if "congregation" or "assembled" could be figurative, perhaps a synecdoche for the entire nation or a metaphor for unity. However, "congregation" (`קְהַ֥ל עֲדַֽת`) is a standard, literal term for a gathering of people, and "assembled" describes their physical state. It is a literal description of a group.

While it is a set phrase in Hebrew for a specific time of day, the instruction specifies to "classify *figurative* idioms as \'idiom\' type." The examples provided for idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the earth") involve clear metaphorical or personifying elements. "Between the two evenings" is a literal, albeit specific, way of describing a time interval (the period between sunset and nightfall).

The instruction is to physically take a portion of it. There is no cross-domain comparison or substitution of a related concept for the blood itself. It is a literal substance involved in a ritual.\n\n2.  **וְנָ֥תְנ֛וּ עַל־שְׁתֵּ֥י הַמְּזוּזֹ֖ת** (and put it on the two doorposts):\n    *   Considered: Whether "doorposts" could be a metonymy for the house or its inhabitants, or if the act of putting blood on them is symbolic in a way that constitutes figurative language.\n    *   Reasoning: "Doorposts" (מְזוּזֹת) are literal architectural components of a doorway. The action of placing blood on them is a direct, physical instruction for a ritual act. While the act itself carries deep symbolic meaning within the Passover narrative (protection from the destroyer), the *language* used to describe the doorposts and the action is literal and descriptive, not figurative. The doorposts are not being likened to something else, nor are they personified.\n\n3.  **וְעַל־הַמַּשְׁק֑וֹף** (and the lintel):\n    *   Considered: Similar to "doorposts," whether "lintel" could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: The "lintel" (מַשְׁק֑וֹף) is also a literal architectural component, the horizontal beam above the doorway. The instruction is to apply blood to it physically. The language is literal and descriptive of a physical object.\n\n4.  **עַ֚ל הַבָּ֣תִּ֔ים** (of the houses):\n    *   Considered: Whether "houses" might represent families or households metonymically.\n    *   Reasoning: While "house" (בַּיִת) can sometimes refer to a household or family in Hebrew, in this context, it refers to the physical dwelling where the Passover meal is to be eaten. The blood is applied to the physical structure of the house. The subsequent phrase "in which they are to eat it" further clarifies that it refers to the physical location.

This is standard narrative language describing a physical action.\n2.  **בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַזֶּ֑ה** (that same night): I considered if "night" could be symbolic of a period of darkness or distress. However, it is a straightforward, literal temporal indicator, specifying when the action is to take place.\n3.  **צְלִי־אֵ֣שׁ** (roasted over the fire / fire-roast): I considered if "fire" or "fire-roast" could be a metonymy for intense heat or a difficult process. However, "צְלִי־אֵשׁ" is a literal description of the cooking method – the meat is to be roasted using fire. It is a compound noun or descriptive phrase indicating preparation, not a figurative comparison.\n4.  **וּמַצּ֔וֹת** (and with unleavened bread): I considered if "unleavened bread" could be a metaphor for haste or purity. While unleavened bread *symbolizes* haste and the lack of time to let dough rise in the broader Passover narrative, the instruction here is to eat the physical, literal food item known as unleavened bread. The text is not using "unleavened bread" to represent something else, but to name a specific food.\n5.  **עַל־מְרֹרִ֖ים** (with bitter herbs / upon bitter things): This was the most significant phrase to consider. I debated whether "מְרֹרִים" (bitter herbs) could be a metaphor for sorrow, hardship, or the bitterness of slavery. While the *symbolism* of bitter herbs in the Passover Seder tradition is indeed to recall the bitterness of slavery, the instruction in this verse is to eat *literal* bitter herbs (specific plants known for their bitter taste). The word "bitter" (מָרֹר) describes the inherent taste quality of these herbs, not a metaphorical state of being or experience. The text is giving a literal dietary instruction for the meal, not using "bitter herbs" as a stand-in for an abstract concept of bitterness. Therefore, it is a literal description of a food item.\n6.  **יֹאכְלֻֽהוּ** (they shall eat it): This is a repetition of the literal action of eating.\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of standard narrative language and the specific instructions provided, I found no clear metaphors, similes, personifications, or non-literal idioms in this verse.

There is no cross-domain comparison or symbolic meaning intended beyond the physical state of being uncooked. It is standard narrative language for a ritual instruction.\n2.  **"or cooked in any way with water" (וּבָשֵׁ֥ל מְבֻשָּׁ֖ל בַּמָּ֑יִם)**:\n    *   Considered if "cooked with water" (boiled) could be a metaphor for an impure, improper, or less potent method of preparation.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal instruction specifying a prohibited method of cooking. It directly contrasts with the commanded method ("roasted over fire"). No figurative meaning is present; it\'s a direct prohibition concerning food preparation.\n3.  **"but roasted—head, legs, and entrails—over the fire" (כִּ֣י אִם־צְלִי־אֵ֔שׁ רֹאשׁ֥וֹ עַל־כְּרָעָ֖יו וְעַל־קִרְבּֽוֹ)**:\n    *   **"roasted over the fire" (צְלִי־אֵשׁ)**:\n        *   Considered if "fire" or "roasted" could have symbolic meaning beyond the literal cooking method (e.g., purification, divine presence, intense judgment).\n        *   Reasoning: While fire can carry symbolic associations elsewhere in the Bible, in this specific context, it is explicitly describing the required, literal method of cooking the Passover lamb. It is a direct instruction for food preparation, not a figurative representation of purification or divine presence.\n    *   **"head, legs, and entrails" (רֹאשׁ֥וֹ עַל־כְּרָעָ֖יו וְעַל־קִרְבּֽוֹ)**:\n        *   Considered if this phrase could be synecdoche (a type of metonymy) where these specific parts represent the whole animal.\n        *   Reasoning: The overarching instruction is to roast the entire lamb.

It is not using a part to stand in for the whole in a general or abstract sense, but rather providing a detailed, literal enumeration of the components that must be included in the complete roasting process. The emphasis is on the completeness and integrity of the animal as it is prepared, ensuring no part is omitted or prepared separately. This is a precise ritual instruction, not a figurative expression.\n\nConclusion: After careful consideration of each phrase, I find no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, hyperbole, or metonymy (including synecdoche) that deviate from a literal, prescriptive meaning in this verse.

However, the strong conventional meaning of "readiness for action/travel" in biblical context, beyond just the physical act, led me to classify it as an idiom.\n2.  **"your sandals on your feet" (נַֽעֲלֵיכֶם֙ בְּרַגְלֵיכֶ֔ם)**\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if this phrase might be a metonymy or an idiom for readiness.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: This is a straightforward, literal instruction for wearing footwear. While it contributes to the overall picture of readiness for travel, the phrase itself does not carry a conventional non-literal meaning beyond its literal sense. It is a direct description of an action.\n3.  **"your staff in your hand" (וּמַקֶּלְכֶ֖ם בְּיֶדְכֶ֑ם)**\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if this phrase might be a metonymy or an idiom for readiness or authority.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: This is a literal instruction to hold a staff, which was a common item for travelers, shepherds, or those on a journey in the ANE. It directly describes a physical action and possession, without a conventional non-literal meaning.\n4.  **"you shall eat it hurriedly" (וַאֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם אֹתוֹ֙ בְּחִפָּז֔וֹן)**\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "hurriedly" might be a hyperbolic description.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: "Hurriedly" is a literal adverb describing the manner of eating. There is no exaggeration or non-literal meaning intended; the instruction is to eat with speed due to the imminent departure.\n5.  **"it is a passover offering to יהוה" (פֶּ֥סַח ה֖וּא לַיהֹוָֽה)**\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "passover offering" (פֶּ֥סַח) might be a metaphor or a symbolic term.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: "Pesach" is a technical term or proper noun for the specific ritual and offering. While the word itself has etymological roots related to "passing over" or "protection," in this context, it functions as a literal designation of the offering\'s identity and purpose. It is a direct statement of what the offering *is*, not a figurative comparison.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, merism is not explicitly listed among the types of figurative language to mark (metaphor, personification, simile, idiom). It functions here as a comprehensive, literal statement encompassing all categories of firstborns. Given the conservative instructions, I decided not to mark it as figurative, as it\'s a rhetorical device for totality rather than a cross-domain comparison or personification.\n\n3.  **וּבְכׇל־אֱלֹהֵ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים** (and I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt):\n    *   **"אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים" (I will mete out punishments / I will execute judgments) to "כׇל־אֱלֹהֵ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם" (all the gods of Egypt):** This phrase was the primary focus for figurative language.\n        *   I considered if "אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים" (I will execute judgments) is an anthropomorphism of God as a judge. While it is, the instructions state divine anthropomorphisms are literal unless referring to God\'s body. So, God\'s action of judging is literal.\n        *   The key question is the *object* of this judgment: "all the gods of Egypt." I debated whether this constitutes personification. In the ANE context, deities (even false ones) were often conceived as active entities. However, the "punishments" here are not literal physical acts *on* the gods themselves (e.g., striking an idol), but rather the demonstration of their impotence and Yahweh\'s supremacy through the plagues.\n        *   By stating that Yahweh will "mete out punishments" to the "gods of Egypt," the text treats these non-human entities (whether understood as spiritual powers or idols) as if they are subjects in a judicial process, capable of being judged and receiving consequences. This application of a human-like judicial action to non-human entities fits the definition of personification. The "punishments" are the plagues themselves, which effectively "defeat" or "judge" the gods by demonstrating their inability to protect Egypt. This is a clear instance of personification, as it attributes a human-like capacity (being subject to judicial punishment) to non-human entities.\n\n4.  **אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָֽה** (I יהוה): This is a literal statement of divine identity.\n\nIn summary, the only element identified as figurative is the personification of the "gods of Egypt" being subject to Yahweh\'s "punishments."\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n2.  **"וְרָאִ֙יתִי֙ אֶת־הַדָּ֔ם" (when I see the blood):** I considered this phrase as a divine anthropomorphism. The act of God "seeing" is an action attributed to God. According to the provided guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms describing actions (e.g., "God went," "God watched") are to be treated as literal in the ANE context, unless they refer to God\'s body parts. Since "seeing" is an action and not a body part, this is considered literal.\n3.  **"וּפָסַחְתִּ֖י עֲלֵכֶ֑ם" (I will pass over you):** I debated whether "pass over" could be interpreted as a metaphor for "sparing" or "protecting." However, the verb פָסַח describes a specific divine action. As a divine anthropomorphism, similar to other actions like "God went," it is to be interpreted literally in the ANE context as per the instructions. The "passing over" describes God\'s direct action of bypassing the marked houses, which results in their protection. It is not a cross-domain comparison but a description of the divine agent\'s movement or non-engagement. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n4.  **"נֶ֙גֶף֙ לְמַשְׁחִ֔ית" (plague will destroy):** I considered if "plague" or "destroy" could be figurative.

"Striking the land of Egypt" (בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם) is a common biblical expression where "land" (אֶרֶץ) stands for its inhabitants or the people residing within it. God is not literally striking the physical soil, but rather the people of Egypt, specifically their firstborn. This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically synecdoche, where the container stands for the contained).

While the English translation "throughout the ages" might sound grand, the Hebrew simply denotes that the observance is to be passed down and kept by successive generations.

In biblical legal and religious contexts, "חֻקַּת עוֹלָם" is a standard technical term signifying an ordinance that is permanently binding and intended to be observed without cessation for the duration of the covenant or the people\'s existence. It describes the inherent, enduring nature of the statute. It is not a metaphor (the statute is not being compared to something else from a different domain), nor a simile. While "for all time" or "everlasting" might be considered hyperbole if interpreted as literally infinite duration beyond any possible end of the world, in the ANE context, it functions as a strong statement of intended permanence and unbroken observance. Given the conservative instructions regarding standard narrative language and the classification of such terms as literal unless a clear cross-domain comparison exists, I do not classify this as figurative. It is a direct description of the statute\'s intended longevity and binding force.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, hyperbole, metonymy) is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"בַּיּ֣וֹם הָרִאשׁ֔וֹן תַּשְׁבִּ֥יתוּ שְּׂאֹ֖ר מִבָּתֵּיכֶ֑ם" (on the very first day you shall remove leaven from your houses):** I considered if "remove leaven" or "from your houses" might be figurative. This is a literal instruction to physically remove a substance (leaven) from a physical location (houses). While leaven can sometimes symbolize corruption in other biblical contexts, in this specific legal command, it refers to the literal substance. There is no metaphorical or symbolic usage here. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְנִכְרְתָ֞ה הַנֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַהִוא֙ מִיִּשְׂרָאֵ֔ל" (that person shall be cut off from Israel):**\n    *   **"הַנֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַהִוא֙" (that person/soul):** I considered if "nefesh" (soul/person) here is a metonymy for the individual. While "nefesh" literally means "soul" or "life-breath" and is used to refer to a person, this usage is so common in biblical Hebrew that it functions almost as a direct synonym for "person" in many contexts, especially legal ones. It\'s not a striking cross-domain comparison or a complex idiom that requires deep figurative interpretation beyond standard lexical usage. Following the conservative instruction, I decided not to mark this specific word as figurative.\n    *   **"וְנִכְרְתָ֞ה... מִיִּשְׂרָאֵ֔ל" (shall be cut off from Israel):** This phrase was carefully considered. The verb כָּרַת (karat) literally means "to cut" or "to cut off." However, in the context of "being cut off from Israel," it does not refer to a literal physical severing of a person from the land or community with a knife. Instead, it is a well-established legal and theological idiom in the Torah, signifying excommunication, expulsion from the covenant community, divine judgment leading to death, or the termination of one\'s lineage. This is a clear **metaphor** because the physical action of "cutting" is applied to a social, spiritual, or existential state of separation. It is also explicitly a **biblical idiom** as per the instructions ("Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type"). This phrase represents a cross-domain comparison (physical cutting vs. social/spiritual exclusion). Therefore, I included this phrase as figurative.\n\n4.  **"מִיּ֥וֹם הָרִאשֹׁ֖ן עַד־י֥וֹם הַשְּׁבִעִֽי" (from the first day to the seventh day):** I considered if this temporal phrase was figurative.

This term is a technical, literal designation for a holy assembly or festival day in biblical law. It directly describes the nature of the day as one set apart for holy gathering.

Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **אַ֚ךְ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵאָכֵ֣ל לְכׇל־נֶ֔פֶשׁ** (only what every person is to eat):\n    *   **What I considered:** I focused on the phrase `לְכׇל־נֶ֔פֶשׁ` (lekol-nefesh), literally "to every soul" or "for every soul," which is translated as "every person." I considered if the use of `נֶפֶשׁ` (nefesh, meaning "soul" or "breath") to refer to an entire "person" or "living being" constitutes figurative language.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This is a classic example of synecdoche, which is a type of metonymy, where a vital part (the soul or life-breath) stands in for the whole living individual (the person). While this usage is extremely common and conventional in biblical Hebrew, making it almost transparent, it is fundamentally a substitution of a part for the whole. The instructions specify that "biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Since synecdoche is a form of figurative language, and this usage is highly conventional, it fits the criteria for both metonymy and idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** The main debate was whether this usage is so conventional that it has lost its figurative force and become a literal equivalent. However, given the explicit instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom," and the clear underlying synecdoche, I determined it should be marked as figurative. It is a transparent figure, but a figure nonetheless, and a common idiom.\n\n5.  **ה֥וּא לְבַדּ֖וֹ יֵעָשֶׂ֥ה לָכֶֽם** (that alone may be prepared for you): I found no figurative language in this phrase.

The command is to "observe *the unleavened bread*," implying adherence to the rules surrounding its preparation, consumption, and removal during the festival. This is a direct instruction concerning the object and its associated practices, rather than a figurative substitution of the object for the broader concept of the festival. It falls under standard narrative language for giving commands about ritual objects.\n\n2.  **בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה** (on this very day / literally "on the bone of this day")\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the phrase "בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה" (b\'etzem hayyom hazzeh) is a literal description or an idiom. The word עֶצֶם (etzem) literally means "bone" or "essence."\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** This is a well-established Hebrew idiom. While עֶצֶם can mean "bone," in this construction, it functions to emphasize the exactness and significance of the timing, meaning "on the very substance/essence of this day" or "on this selfsame day." It is not a literal comparison of a day to a bone, but a fixed expression used to convey emphasis.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None, this is a clear idiom.\n\n3.  **הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אֶת־צִבְאוֹתֵיכֶ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם** (I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if referring to the Israelites as "צִבְאוֹתֵיכֶ֖ם" (tziv\'oteikhem, "your hosts" or "your ranks/armies") might be a metaphor or hyperbole, given that they were not a trained military army in the modern sense.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** In biblical Hebrew, צָבָא (tzava) and its plural צְבָאוֹת (tzva\'ot) can refer to a large multitude, a host, or an organized body of people, not exclusively a military force. In the context of the Exodus, it emphasizes the vast number of people and their organized departure under divine leadership. This is a descriptive term for a large, moving group, not a cross-domain comparison or an exaggeration beyond the biblical understanding of their collective identity. It is standard narrative language describing the people.\n\n4.  **לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶ֖ם חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָֽם** (throughout your generations as an institution for all time)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶ֖ם" (throughout your generations) and "חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָֽם" (an institution for all time / an eternal statute) could be hyperbole, implying an indefinite but not strictly eternal duration.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** In the context of divine commands and covenants in the Hebrew Bible, "עוֹלָם" (olam) signifies a perpetual, enduring, or everlasting quality from God\'s perspective, intended to last for the entire duration of the covenant or the current world order. These phrases are standard ways to express the permanence and binding nature of a divine law within the biblical worldview, not an exaggeration.

Reasoning: In this specific legal and ritual context concerning the Passover and Unleavened Bread, "leaven" (שְׂאֹר) refers literally to fermented dough. The instruction is about the physical removal of leaven from physical houses. Therefore, it is not figurative here. "Your houses" is also a literal reference to dwellings.\n3.  **"כׇּל־אֹכֵ֣ל מַחְמֶ֗צֶת" (whoever eats what is leavened)**: Considered if "eating" could be a metaphor for participating in or endorsing something forbidden. Reasoning: This refers to the literal act of consuming leavened food. It is not figurative.\n4.  **"הַנֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַהִוא֙" (that person/soul)**: Considered if "נֶפֶשׁ" (soul) is a metonymy (specifically synecdoche) for the entire person. Reasoning: In biblical Hebrew, נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh) frequently refers to the whole living individual, the self, or a person, rather than solely an immaterial soul in the modern philosophical sense. Using a vital part (the life-breath/soul) to represent the whole living being is a common linguistic device. This is a clear instance of metonymy.\n5.  **"וְנִכְרְתָ֞ה... מֵעֲדַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל" (shall be cut off from the community of Israel)**: Considered if "cut off" is a literal physical cutting or an idiom for excommunication or divine judgment. Reasoning: The verb כרת (karat) literally means "to cut," "to cut down," or "to cut off." However, in the context of being "cut off from the community of Israel" (מֵעֲדַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל), it is a well-established biblical idiom signifying expulsion from the covenant community, often implying divine judgment leading to premature death or severe social ostracization, rather than a literal physical severing of a body part. This is a standard legal/theological idiom.\n6.  **"מֵעֲדַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל" (from the community of Israel)**: Considered if "community" is used metaphorically. Reasoning: This refers to the literal assembly or congregation of Israel. It is not figurative.\n7.  **"בַּגֵּ֖ר וּבְאֶזְרַ֥ח הָאָֽרֶץ" (whether a stranger or a citizen of the country)**: Considered if these terms are symbolic.

The context is a dietary law. There is no explicit linguistic cue within this verse itself to suggest a cross-domain comparison or symbolic meaning beyond its literal culinary definition.

The instruction is a direct dietary requirement. While it carries deep symbolic meaning in its wider context, this verse itself does not employ figurative language to convey that meaning.

The word פָּסַח (Pesach/Passover) primarily refers to the festival itself, commemorating the "passing over" event. However, one does not literally "slaughter a festival." Instead, one slaughters the *animal* (lamb or kid) that is central to the Passover ritual.

However, the phrase literally refers to the physical object to be used. It is a direct instruction for an action involving a specific plant, not a figurative representation of something else. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"וּטְבַלְתֶּם֮ בַּדָּ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־בַּסַּף֒" (dip it in the blood that is in the basin):** This phrase describes a literal action of dipping the hyssop into a physical substance (blood) contained in a physical object (basin). I considered if "blood" itself might be a metonymy or symbol. While blood carries profound symbolic and ritualistic meaning in the broader biblical context (representing life, atonement, protection), the *language* used here to describe the act of dipping into it is entirely literal. The text does not say "dip it in your protection" or "dip it in your life," but explicitly "in the blood." The instruction is to perform a physical action with a physical substance. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְהִגַּעְתֶּ֤ם אֶל־הַמַּשְׁקוֹף֙ וְאֶל־שְׁתֵּ֣י הַמְּזוּזֹ֔ת מִן־הַדָּ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּסָּ֑ף" (and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and to the two doorposts):** Similar to the previous phrase, this describes a literal action of applying a physical substance (blood) to specific physical parts of a doorway (lintel and doorposts). Again, while the *act* of applying the blood has immense symbolic significance within the Passover narrative (marking the houses for protection from the destroyer), the *language* used to convey this instruction is direct and literal. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic expression. The blood is literally applied to the doorframe.

"The door of your house" (פֶּתַח־בֵּיתוֹ) refers to the physical opening of the dwelling. There is no hidden meaning, metaphor, or idiom present. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse provides clear, direct instructions for a ritualistic act.

However, the instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "going through" is an action attributed to God and does not refer to a specific body part, it is treated as a literal statement of God\'s action in the ANE context.

While its literal root meaning is "to skip" or "to pass over," in the Passover narrative, it takes on a specialized, theological meaning of divine protection and *sparing* from judgment. It implies more than just a physical movement over the door; it signifies God\'s deliberate act of bypassing the marked homes for the purpose of salvation. The English translation\'s note ("*pass over See note at v. 13.") further suggests this is a term with a specific, perhaps non-obvious, meaning beyond its most basic literal sense. This specialized meaning, tied to a specific ritual and event, makes it function as an idiom. Therefore, I have included this phrase as an idiom.\n\n6.  **וְלֹ֤א יִתֵּן֙ הַמַּשְׁחִ֔ית / and not let the Destroyer**: I considered if "the Destroyer" (הַמַּשְׁחִית) should be marked as personification. However, in biblical theology, "the Destroyer" refers to a specific divine agent, often understood as an angel of death, rather than an abstract concept of destruction personified. Given the instruction to be conservative and to treat divine agents and their actions literally in the ANE context, this is considered a literal reference to a specific entity. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n7.  **לָבֹ֥א אֶל־בָּתֵּיכֶ֖ם לִנְגֹּֽף / enter and smite your home**: These are literal actions. I considered no figurative meaning here.

In this context, "this thing" directly refers to the preceding divine instruction. "Observing" (שׁמר) is a literal action of keeping, guarding, or obeying. This is standard, literal narrative language for conveying a legal or ethical instruction. It is not a figurative expression.\n\n2.  **לְחׇק־לְךָ֥** (as an institution/statute for you):\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "חֹק" (choq), meaning "statute" or "institution," could be used metaphorically.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "חֹק" is a literal, technical term for a decree, ordinance, or established practice in biblical law.

While in some contexts, "forever" can be interpreted as hyperbole (e.g., for a human king\'s reign), in the context of a divine institution or covenant, it often signifies true perpetuity within the divine plan or the duration of the covenant. The instructions state to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify *figurative* idioms as \'idiom\' type." This implies that not all idioms are figurative. Given that this refers to a divine decree intended to be a lasting institution, the phrase "for all time" is best understood as a literal statement of its intended perpetual duration, rather than an exaggeration. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or simile. Therefore, it is a standard temporal idiom, but not a *figurative* one in this specific context.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis and the provided guidelines, no figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, hyperbole, metonymy, or figurative idiom) is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It is standard narrative language for a physical action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִתֵּ֧ן יְהֹוָ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם** (that יהוה will give you): I considered if "יהוה will give" could be a metaphor for divine provision or a more abstract form of blessing. However, the act of God "giving" the land is a direct divine anthropomorphism, describing God\'s action of bestowing possession. The guidelines explicitly state that divine anthropomorphisms (like "God went," "God was angry," "God watched," "God fought") are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body.

"עֲבֹדָה" is a literal term for service or work, often in a cultic context. The "לָכֶֽם" (to you/for you) literally asks about the relevance, meaning, or purpose *for* the people performing the rite.

The word פֶּסַח (pesach) means "pass over" and refers to the event where God passed over the Israelite houses. The sacrifice is *named* after this pivotal event. This is a clear case of metonymy, where the event (God\'s passing over) gives its name to the ritual (the sacrifice) that commemorates it. The name of the sacrifice is derived from the action it memorializes. It is not an idiom in the sense of a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from its parts, but rather a descriptive name formed through association. Therefore, I classify this as metonymy.\n    *   **"ה֜וּא לַֽיהֹוָ֗ה" (to יהוה)**: This indicates dedication or ownership. It is a literal statement about the recipient of the sacrifice. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּ֠סַ֠ח עַל־בָּתֵּ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם" (who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt)**:\n    *   **"פָּ֠סַ֠ח" (passed over) by יהוה**: This describes an action performed by God.

Thus, they are not figurative.\n\n2.  **"בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל" (the Israelites / sons of Israel):** I considered if "sons of Israel" might be a figurative idiom. While it literally means "sons of Israel" and refers to the descendants, it functions as a collective noun for the nation. The guidelines state to classify *figurative* idioms as "idiom" type, providing examples like "mouth of the sword" or "face of the earth." These examples involve a clear figurative mapping (e.g., a sword having a "mouth"). "Sons of Israel" is a literal genealogical descriptor that became the standard way to refer to the people/nation.

This phrase falls under a proportional or behavioral comparison, indicating the manner in which the Israelites acted was in accordance with the command.

A dungeon often *is* a confined dwelling (a "house" in the sense of a place of habitation, even if involuntary) that is pit-like, often underground or a deep cell. The meaning can be reasonably deduced from the literal words describing a specific type of structure. The guidelines emphasize being conservative with standard narrative language and only classifying *figurative* idioms, providing examples like "mouth of the sword" which are clearly non-literal cross-domain comparisons. "House of the pit" does not involve such a clear non-literal meaning or cross-domain comparison. It is a descriptive compound noun.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was a borderline case.

While a vast number of Egyptians would have been affected by the plague and would have been awake and crying out, it is highly improbable that *every single Egyptian* in the entire land literally arose at that exact moment. The purpose is to convey the widespread and universal panic and mourning across the entire nation, emphasizing the overwhelming scale of the disaster.

While the plague of the firstborn was catastrophic and widespread, it is an exaggeration to claim that *literally every single house* in Egypt contained a dead person. For instance, houses without firstborns, or houses of non-Egyptians (if any were not affected by the plague, though the text implies universal Egyptian suffering), would not have had a dead person.

"In the night" is a literal temporal descriptor. Both are standard narrative language describing character actions and setting. No figurative language is present.\n\n2.  **וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙** (and said):\n    *   **Considered:** This is a standard narrative conjunction introducing direct speech.\n    *   **Reasoning:** It is a literal description of a character\'s action. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **ק֤וּמוּ** (Up / Arise):\n    *   **Considered:** If this imperative could be an idiom for "begin" or "start an action" in a purely abstract sense, rather than a literal physical rising.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "קוּם" (qum) can initiate action, its primary meaning is to rise from a sitting or lying position, or to stand up. In the context of "depart from among my people," it functions as a direct command to physically get up and prepare to move. It is a literal precursor to physical departure, not a purely abstract command to "begin." Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n4.  **צְּאוּ֙ מִתּ֣וֹךְ עַמִּ֔י** (depart from among my people):\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "מִתּוֹךְ עַמִּי" ("from among my people" or "from the midst of my people") could be a figurative expression for leaving the "heart" or "essence" of the people.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "צְּאוּ" (tse\'u) is a literal command to go out or depart. "מִתּוֹךְ" (mittoch) literally means "from the midst of" or "from inside." This phrase describes a literal spatial separation from the group of Pharaoh\'s people. It refers to their physical presence within the community, not a metaphorical core or spirit. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n5.  **גַּם־אַתֶּ֖ם גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל** (you and the Israelites with you!):\n    *   **Considered:** This is a direct identification of the recipients of the command.\n    *   **Reasoning:** It is a literal statement identifying the individuals and group being addressed. No figurative language is present.\n\n6.  **וּלְכ֛וּ עִבְד֥וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֖ה** (Go, worship יהוה / Go, serve יהוה):\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "עִבְד֥וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (ivdu et YHWH) could be a metaphorical expression for something other than direct worship or service.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "וּלְכ֛וּ" (u-lekhu) is a literal command to go. The verb עבד (ʿavad) means "to serve," "to work," or "to worship." In this context, it refers to the literal act of serving God through worship or obedience, which is a direct religious action. It is a literal instruction for their behavior towards God. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n\n7.  **כְּדַבֶּרְכֶֽם** (as you said / as you spoke):\n    *   **Considered:** This phrase refers to previous speech.\n    *   **Reasoning:** It is a literal reference to prior statements or promises made by Moses and Aaron (and the Israelites). No figurative language is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** After careful examination of each phrase against the provided criteria, I have found no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or biblical idioms that would classify as figurative language in this verse. The text consists of direct commands and literal narrative descriptions.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While the *desired effect* of the blessing is spiritual or divine, the *request itself* is for a literal action. It is not a clear cross-domain comparison (metaphor/simile), nor personification. It does not fit the examples of biblical idioms provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword") which are clearly non-literal combinations.

In this context, "Egypt" clearly refers to the people or the authorities of Egypt, rather than the geographical landmass itself acting. This is a very common figure of speech where a place name stands for its inhabitants or government. Therefore, I am including it as metonymy.\n    *   **וַתֶּחֱזַ֤ק עַל־הָעָ֔ם** (urged the people on / strengthened itself against the people): I considered if this verb phrase, describing the Egyptians\' forceful action, might be figurative. The verb חזק (ḥazaq) in this context describes a direct, forceful action of compelling or strengthening one\'s resolve/action against another. It is a literal description of their physical and verbal efforts to expel the Israelites. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an idiomatic expression beyond its standard lexical meaning. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n2.  **לְמַהֵ֖ר לְשַׁלְּחָ֣ם מִן־הָאָ֑רֶץ** (impatient to have them leave the country)\n    *   **לְמַהֵ֖ר לְשַׁלְּחָ֣ם** (to hasten to send them): I considered if this phrase describing the urgency of their action was figurative. This is a straightforward description of their desire and intent to expedite the departure of the Israelites. It is a literal statement of their actions and motivation. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n    *   **מִן־הָאָ֑רֶץ** (from the country/land): I considered if "the land" was figurative. This refers literally to the geographical territory of Egypt. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n3.  **כִּ֥י אָמְר֖וּ כֻּלָּ֥נוּ מֵתִֽים** (for they said, “We shall all be dead.”)\n    *   **אָמְר֖וּ** (they said): This is a literal reporting of speech. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n    *   **כֻּלָּ֥נוּ מֵתִֽים** (We shall all be dead / We are all dying): I considered this phrase as potential hyperbole. The Egyptians are expressing extreme fear and the perceived imminence of widespread death due to the plagues. While many Egyptians had indeed died, the statement "all of us" (כֻּלָּ֥נוּ) is an exaggeration of the current reality. It is an overstatement used to convey the severity of their situation and their desperate fear of complete annihilation, rather than a literal prediction that every single Egyptian will die immediately. This rhetorical overstatement fits the definition of hyperbole. Therefore, I am including it as hyperbole.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The phrase uses a physical body part (eyes) to represent a cognitive or emotional state (opinion/favor).

The narrative describes the Israelites taking significant valuables (silver, gold, clothing) from the Egyptians. While the English translation "stripped" might evoke a sense of totality that could border on hyperbole, the Hebrew verb primarily denotes the act of plundering or taking spoils. Given the instruction to be conservative with "standard narrative language" and "character actions," and that taking spoils is a direct action, this is best understood as a literal description of the plundering event, not a figurative cross-domain comparison or an exaggeration beyond the scope of the actual event (taking their wealth).

My reasoning for excluding it is twofold: first, the presence of "כְּ" (about/approximately) indicates that the number is presented as an estimate rather than an exaggerated figure intended to be understood non-literally. Second, the instruction to be conservative with historical information, including numbers, suggests that unless there\'s a clear rhetorical intent for exaggeration beyond the literal, it should be treated as a large, but stated, approximate quantity within the narrative.\n3.  **רַגְלִ֛י הַגְּבָרִ֖ים** (fighting men on foot): I considered if this phrase might be a form of metonymy or synecdoche. My reasoning for including it as metonymy (specifically synecdoche) is that "רַגְלִ֛י" (literally "of foot" or "on foot") is used here to characterize and represent the entire class of soldiers who fight on foot, i.e., infantry. While the men literally have feet and are on foot, the term "foot" stands in for their military role and identity as foot soldiers, rather than merely describing their physical posture.

It is a direct, descriptive term for a diverse group of people who were not ethnically Israelite but joined them in the Exodus. It accurately describes the composition of the group without employing a cross-domain comparison or substitution. Therefore, it is standard narrative language and not figurative.\n\n2.  **"עָלָ֣ה אִתָּ֑ם" (went up with them):**\n    *   **Considered:** If "went up" might be figurative, implying a spiritual ascent or rise in status.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In the context of the Exodus, `עָלָה` (to go up) is a literal verb of motion describing the physical departure from Egypt and the journey towards Canaan. This movement often involved an ascent in elevation from the low Nile valley to the higher land of Canaan. It is standard narrative language and not figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְצֹ֣אן וּבָקָ֔ר" (flocks and herds):**\n    *   **Considered:** If these terms for livestock could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** `צֹאן` (sheep and goats) and `בָקָר` (cattle) are literal, standard terms for specific types of animals. They are not used in a metaphorical, metonymic, or personified sense here. Therefore, they are not figurative.\n\n4.  **"מִקְנֶ֖ה כָּבֵ֥ד מְאֹֽד" (very much livestock / very heavy livestock):**\n    *   **Considered:** If `כָּבֵד` (heavy) when applied to `מִקְנֶה` (livestock) is a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While `כָּבֵד` primarily means "heavy" in weight, in biblical Hebrew, when it describes `מִקְנֶה` (livestock), it conventionally means "numerous," "abundant," or "great in quantity" (e.g., Genesis 13:2, 30:43, 46:6). This is not a literal statement about the physical weight of each animal, but rather an idiomatic expression conveying the substantiality, numerosity, and value of the livestock. The concept of "heaviness" (a physical quality) is used to describe "numerousness" or "abundance" (a quantitative quality). This constitutes a conceptual mapping that is characteristic of an idiom, where the meaning is not purely literal but conventionalized. As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, `מִקְנֶה כָּבֵד` is classified as an idiom. The intensifier `מְאֹד` ("very") simply amplifies this idiomatic meaning and is not figurative itself.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This is a standard lexical function of the noun derived from the verb יָשַׁב (yashav, to sit/dwell), not a figurative substitution.

While the literal components might suggest a cross-domain comparison (day having a "bone"), its idiomatic usage is so common and fixed that it functions as a single unit of meaning.

When applied to the Israelites, it likens the entire body of people to an organized military force or a vast, disciplined company under divine command. The Israelites are not literally a standing army in the conventional sense (e.g., equipped with weapons, trained for battle at this specific moment of departure), but they are God\'s people, united and led by Him, whose departure from Egypt is often framed in terms of a divine military operation. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison (people to a military host/army), emphasizing their unity, divine leadership, and purpose. This fits the criteria for a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons." While it is a common designation for the Israelites in this context, its underlying structure is metaphorical. Therefore, it is included as figurative (metaphor).\n    *   **Borderline case debate:** I debated whether this was simply a standard, literal designation for the Israelites as God\'s people, or a metaphor. The decision to classify it as a metaphor rests on the strong military connotation of "צְבָאָה" and the conceptual comparison it creates between the people and an organized military host. Even if it\'s a common way to refer to them, the comparison itself is inherent in the term\'s primary meaning.\n\n4.  **"מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם" (from the land of Egypt)**\n    *   **Considered:** If this geographical reference could be symbolic.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal geographical reference.

However, "night of vigil" is best understood as a literal description of the nature or purpose of the night—a night characterized by watching or observance. The night itself is not performing the action of watching; rather, the watching is an activity that occurs during the night, performed by God (implied in the first clause) and by Israel (in the second clause). Therefore, it is not personification. It is also not a clear metonymy where one concept stands for another in a non-literal way, but rather a direct description of the night\'s quality. I concluded this is a literal descriptive phrase.\n\n2.  **"הוּא֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה לְהוֹצִיאָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם" (it was for Yahweh to bring them out of the land of Egypt)**: This describes God\'s action and purpose. The act of God bringing them out is a divine anthropomorphism (God acting), which the instructions state should be considered literal in the ANE context unless referring to God\'s body.

"Yahweh\'s" indicates dedication or possession, which is literal. I concluded these are literal statements.\n\n4.  **"לְכׇל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל" (for all the children of Israel)**: I considered if "children of Israel" (בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל) is a literal reference to young offspring or an idiom for the entire nation. While `בְּנֵי` literally means "sons" or "children," in the context of "בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל," it is a well-established biblical idiom that refers to the entire people/nation descended from Jacob (Israel), encompassing all ages and genders, not just literal young children. This phrase functions as a collective noun for the Israelites. This is a form of metonymy, specifically synecdoche, where "sons/children" stands for "descendants" or "members of the collective group/nation."

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **לֹא־תוֹצִ֧יא מִן־הַבַּ֛יִת מִן־הַבָּשָׂ֖ר ח֑וּצָה** (you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house)\n    *   Considered: If "flesh" (הַבָּשָׂר) might be a synecdoche for the entire animal or a metonymy for the sacrificial meal itself.\n    *   Reasoning: "Flesh" here refers literally to the edible meat of the Passover lamb.

In this context, the stranger, after circumcision, gains the *same rights and status* as a native-born citizen *for the specific purpose of offering the Passover*.

It is not a figurative comparison or a non-literal representation in the sense of a metaphor or personification. It\'s a conventional way to refer to the descendants of Israel as a collective entity.\n\n4.  **מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם (from the land of Egypt):**\n    *   **What I considered:** This is a straightforward geographical reference.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal statement about the origin of their departure.

It is a literal command.\n\n2.  **"כׇל־בְּכ֜וֹר" (every male first-born):** This is a straightforward, literal description of the subject of the consecration. No figurative language is involved.\n\n3.  **"פֶּ֤טֶר כׇּל־רֶ֙חֶם֙" (the first [male] issue of every womb):** I carefully considered if this phrase, "פֶּטֶר רֶחֶם" (peter rechem), should be classified as an idiom. While it is a set phrase in biblical Hebrew, it functions as a precise, technical biological term for the "firstborn" or "first opening of the womb." "פֶּטֶר" literally means "opening" or "firstborn" (as the one who opens the womb), and "רֶחֶם" means "womb." Thus, "opening of the womb" is a direct and literal description of the biological event of the first birth. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an obvious simile. Unlike examples provided for idioms (e.g., "face of the earth" or "mouth of the sword"), this phrase does not use a concrete image to represent an abstract concept or a different concrete entity in a non-literal way. It is a literal definition of *which* firstborn is being referred to. Therefore, I concluded it is a literal biological/legal term, not a figurative idiom.\n\n4.  **"בִּבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל" (among the Israelites):** This is a literal geographical and social identifier.

No figurative language is present.\n\n6.  **"לִ֖י הֽוּא" (is Mine):** This is a direct statement of divine ownership or claim. It is a literal assertion of God\'s right to the firstborn. While it refers to God, it is not an anthropomorphism of action, emotion, or a bodily part that would require specific consideration under the guidelines. It is a literal statement of possession.\n\nBased on this analysis, I find no instances of figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, hyperbole, metonymy, or figurative idiom) in this verse according to the provided conservative guidelines.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְצָאתֶ֤ם מִמִּצְרַ֙יִם֙** (on which you went free from Egypt): This describes a literal historical event of departure. I considered if "went free" could be a euphemism, but it accurately describes the act of liberation. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **מִבֵּ֣ית עֲבָדִ֔ים** (the house of bondage): I considered if this phrase is a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom for Egypt. While Egypt is not literally a single "house," the phrase "house of X" (בֵּית X) is a well-established biblical idiom used to describe a state, condition, or institution. Here, "house" functions as a metonymy for the system or state of slavery that characterized the Israelites\' experience in Egypt. It refers to Egypt as the place and condition of their servitude. This is a clear case of both an idiom and metonymy.\n\n5.  **כִּ֚י בְּחֹ֣זֶק יָ֔ד הוֹצִ֧יא יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם מִזֶּ֑ה** (how יהוה freed you from it with a mighty hand): I considered if **בְּחֹ֣זֶק יָ֔ד** ("with a mighty hand" or "with a strong hand") is a divine anthropomorphism, metonymy, or idiom. The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms are literal "unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Hand" is a part of God\'s body, so this phrase is indeed figurative. Furthermore, "mighty hand" (יָד חֲזָקָה / בְּחֹזֶק יָד) is a very common biblical idiom used to denote God\'s powerful intervention and strength, not a literal physical hand. It is a metonymy where a part (hand) represents the whole (God\'s power and action). Therefore, it is both an idiom and metonymy.\n\n6.  **וְלֹ֥א יֵאָכֵ֖ל חָמֵֽץ** (no leavened bread shall be eaten): This is a literal command regarding dietary practice.

However, "seven days" is a literal duration of time, commonly used in the Bible for specific periods (e.g., creation, festivals). There is no indication here that it is meant to be an exaggeration or to represent something other than a literal week-long period.

This is a well-established biblical idiom signifying the verbalization, recitation, study, and internalization of God\'s laws.

However, this is a standard, technical term in biblical Hebrew for the first offspring. While "womb" (רֶחֶם) is a part of the animal, "פֶּֽטֶר־רֶ֖חֶם" as a whole phrase functions as a literal descriptor for the firstborn, not a figurative stand-in. It directly refers to the initial product of the womb. It is not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile. It is a precise, literal designation.\n    *   I also considered if "womb" itself could be metonymy for the mother, but it is literally referring to the anatomical source of the offspring.\n\n3.  **"לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה" (for יהוה / shall be יהוה’s):** This phrase indicates dedication or ownership.

While one might argue that a specific action (breaking the neck) could stand in for the general concept of killing (a form of metonymy/synecdoche), the conservative guidelines emphasize that standard narrative language and character actions are literal. In a prescriptive legal/ritual text, the specificity of "breaking its neck" is best understood as a literal instruction for the required method of execution, rather than a figurative representation of killing in general. It\'s not merely a way of saying "kill it," but specifically "kill it *by breaking its neck*."

While the sign itself carries symbolic meaning, the act of wearing it is a concrete, physical instruction. The text is not saying the hand *is* a sign, but that something *on* the hand serves as one.

These objects serve as a "symbol" or reminder, but the instruction is for a literal, physical act of wearing them.

It does not suggest God possesses a literal, physical hand in the human sense that performs actions. Instead, it uses the physical instrument (the hand) to represent God\'s immense power, authority, and effective agency in bringing about the Exodus. This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part stands for the whole or the instrument for the power/agent) and a biblical idiom. It falls under the instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type.\n    *   Decision: Mark as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n4.  **"הוֹצִיאָ֥נוּ יְהֹוָ֖ה מִמִּצְרָֽיִם" (יהוה freed us from Egypt)**:\n    *   Considered: Whether this statement is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a straightforward historical statement describing a literal event—the Exodus from Egypt.

The verb נחם (Nif\'al) here.\n    *   Reasoning: The verb נחם (Nif\'al) in this context describes an internal, psychological shift in the people\'s resolve, intention, or disposition, often implying regret or reconsideration. While the English translation "change of heart" is an idiom, the Hebrew verb itself functions idiomatically to convey this internal shift in will or resolve, rather than a literal physical action or a direct metaphor. It refers to a psychological state that leads to a change in behavior. This fits the classification of a biblical idiom describing an internal, non-physical state.\n    *   Borderline cases: One might argue this is simply a literal description of a psychological process. However, the verb נחם (Nif\'al) often carries a deeper sense of regret or a fundamental shift in one\'s inner disposition, which is more than a simple cognitive change. This nuanced meaning, especially when leading to a significant reversal of action (returning to Egypt), aligns with the idiomatic use of language to describe profound internal states in biblical Hebrew. Therefore, classifying it as an idiom for a change in resolve is appropriate.\n    *   Considered: "בִּרְאֹתָ֥ם מִלְחָמָ֖ה" (when they see war) and "וְשָׁ֥בוּ מִצְרָֽיְמָה" (and return to Egypt).\n    *   Reasoning: These are literal descriptions of the people\'s actions and the event of war.

My reasoning is that this phrase describes a literal, physical detour or change of route for the people\'s travel. It is a straightforward narrative description of their movement.\n\n2.  **דֶּ֥רֶךְ הַמִּדְבָּ֖ר יַם־ס֑וּף** / "by way of the wilderness at the Sea of Reeds":\n    *   I considered if "way of the wilderness" (דֶּ֥רֶךְ הַמִּדְבָּ֖ר) could be an idiom or metaphor for a difficult life path.

It is a literal description of the physical location of their journey.\n    *   "Sea of Reeds" (יַם־ס֑וּף) is a proper geographical name. I considered if it could be a metaphorical name, but it functions as a literal identifier for a specific body of water.\n\n3.  **וַחֲמֻשִׁ֛ים עָל֥וּ בְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל** / "Now the Israelites went up armed":\n    *   I considered if "חֲמֻשִׁ֛ים" (ḥamushim), translated as "armed" (with the note about its uncertain meaning), could be figurative. While its precise meaning (e.g., "armed," "in battle array," "five abreast") is debated, all interpretations describe a literal state, condition, or formation of the people. It is not a metaphor for their spirit or an abstract quality, but a physical description of their readiness or arrangement. Therefore, it is literal.\n    *   I considered if "עָל֥וּ" (ʿalu) / "went up" could be figurative, implying an increase in status or a spiritual ascent. However, "עָלָה" (alah) is a common verb for physical movement, often used for departing from Egypt (a lower geographical/political state) or ascending to a higher region (like Canaan). Here, it describes the physical act of departing from Egypt. It is a literal description of their movement.\n\n4.  **מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם** / "out of the land of Egypt":\n    *   I considered if "land of Egypt" could be used metonymically or metaphorically.

However, in the context of an oath concerning the physical remains of a deceased person to be carried for reburial, "bones" is the most literal and accurate description of what would be transported. The oath specifically refers to "my bones," indicating the physical remnants. Therefore, I concluded this is not figurative language but a literal reference to the physical remains.\n\n2.  **"הַשְׁבֵּ֨עַ הִשְׁבִּ֜יעַ" (exacted an oath / swearing, he swore):** I considered this phrase as a potential idiom. This is an infinitive absolute construction (infinitive absolute + finite verb), a standard grammatical feature in Biblical Hebrew used to emphasize the certainty, intensity, or duration of the verbal action. While it literally means "swearing, he swore," its idiomatic function is to convey strong emphasis. This fits the definition of a "biblical idiom" or "set phrase" as it\'s a conventional grammatical structure with a specific rhetorical purpose beyond the sum of its parts.\n\n3.  **"פָּקֹ֨ד יִפְקֹ֤ד" (will be sure to take notice / visiting, he will visit):** Similar to the previous phrase, this is also an infinitive absolute construction (infinitive absolute + finite verb). Its function is to emphasize the certainty and definiteness of God\'s action, meaning God will *certainly* remember, attend to, or act on behalf of the Israelites. This is a standard grammatical idiom for emphasis.\n\n4.  **"אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶתְכֶ֔ם" (God... you) in "פָּקֹ֨ד יִפְקֹ֤ד אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶתְכֶ֔ם" (God will be sure to take notice of you):** I considered if God "taking notice" or "visiting" could be an anthropomorphism. However, the instruction states that divine anthropomorphisms are literal unless they refer to God\'s body. "Taking notice" or "visiting" is an action, not a body part (like "God\'s finger"). It describes God\'s active involvement and care, which is a literal theological concept in the ANE context.

The wilderness (מִדְבָּר) is a physical geographical feature, and it naturally has boundaries or edges. This is a precise spatial description of their encampment location relative to a known geographical feature. It is not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an idiom with a non-literal meaning.

However, the instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "God went" is provided as an example of a literal anthropomorphism and does not refer to a specific body part, I have concluded it is to be interpreted literally within this framework and thus not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **בְּעַמּ֤וּד עָנָן֙ / in a pillar of cloud**: I considered if "pillar of cloud" might be a metaphor or simile. The text describes a physical manifestation that the Israelites observed. It is presented as a direct, factual description of a miraculous phenomenon where the cloud itself took on a pillar-like form. It is not comparing the cloud to a pillar in a figurative sense (e.g., "the cloud was *like* a pillar"), but rather describing the literal shape and composition of the divine presence.

The act of "speaking" is an action attributed to God, similar to "went," "was angry," "watched," or "fought." It does not refer to a specific body part of God (like "God\'s finger" would).

It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal meaning in the same way as the examples provided for idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword" for the edge of a sword). Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **וְיָשֻׁ֗בוּ** (to turn back):\n    *   **Considered:** This is a literal action.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The verb describes a straightforward physical movement. It is not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְיַחֲנוּ֙ לִפְנֵי֙ פִּ֣י הַחִירֹ֔ת** (and encamp before Pi-hahiroth):\n    *   **Considered:** If "פִּ֣י הַחִירֹ֔ת" (Pi-hahiroth / Mouth of Hahiroth) contains figurative language, specifically personification or metaphor, due to the word "פִּ֣י" (mouth).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Hebrew word פֶּה (peh) literally means "mouth." When applied to a geographical feature or place name, as in "Mouth of Hahiroth," it describes an opening, entrance, or narrow pass. This constitutes an attribution of a human body part (mouth) to a non-human entity (a geographical location or feature). Although this usage is conventional in geographical terminology across many languages (e.g., "mouth of a river"), its underlying structure fits the definition of personification, where a non-human entity is described with human characteristics. The instructions explicitly state to "Mark as figurative: Personification of non-human entities." A geographical feature is a non-human entity. This is marked as personification.\n\n4.  **בֵּ֥ין מִגְדֹּ֖ל וּבֵ֣ין הַיָּ֑ם** (between Migdol and the sea):\n    *   **Considered:** This is a literal spatial description.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase provides a direct, factual description of the location.

It describes a literal action (speaking) and its subject (the Israelites). Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **נְבֻכִ֥ים הֵ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ** (They are astray in the land):\n    *   Considered: If "astray" (נְבֻכִים) could be used metaphorically.\n    *   Reasoning: While "astray" can sometimes be used metaphorically for moral or spiritual wandering, in this specific context, Pharaoh is describing the Israelites\' physical predicament in the wilderness. He believes they are lost or confused about their path geographically. This is a literal description of their physical state and location. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **סָגַ֥ר עֲלֵיהֶ֖ם הַמִּדְבָּֽר** (the wilderness has closed in on them):\n    *   Considered: This phrase for personification, metaphor, or idiom.\n    *   Reasoning:\n        *   **Personification**: The wilderness (הַמִּדְבָּר), an inanimate geographical entity, is attributed the active, human-like agency of "closing in" (סָגַר עֲלֵיהֶם). A wilderness does not literally "close" like a door or a trap. This attribution of an active verb to an inanimate object is a clear instance of personification.\n        *   **Metaphor**: By stating that the wilderness "closed in on them," Pharaoh is implicitly comparing the wilderness to something that can physically enclose or trap, such as a wall, a gate, or a snare. The wilderness is not literally these things, but it is described as having their trapping quality. Personification is a specific type of metaphor where human qualities or actions are attributed to non-human entities.\n        *   **Idiom**: I considered if this might be a standard biblical idiom for being trapped. However, the phrase "סָגַר עֲלֵיהֶם הַמִּדְבָּר" is not listed among the common biblical idioms or set phrases provided in the instructions (e.g., לְפִי־חָֽרֶב, פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה, פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה). The application of "סָגַר" to "הַמִּדְבָּר" is a creative, figurative expression rather than a fixed idiomatic phrase.\n    *   Borderline Cases: The line between a vivid description and personification can sometimes be subtle. However, the verb "סָגַר" (to close, shut, imprison) strongly implies an active, intentional action that is beyond the literal capacity of a vast, open wilderness. The wilderness itself is not a physical barrier that can be closed. Thus, attributing this action to it is clearly figurative.\n    *   Decision: Mark as both personification and metaphor.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It does not refer to a literal physical hardening of the organ, but rather to a psychological state of stubbornness, obstinacy, or unyielding resolve. The "heart" (לֵב) in biblical thought is often considered the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, not just a pump. Therefore, "stiffening" it is a metaphorical way of describing God\'s action of making Pharaoh\'s will unchangeable or resistant to persuasion. Given the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and its clear metaphorical basis, I will mark it as both an idiom and a metaphor.\n    *   **Decision:** Mark as figurative (idiom and metaphor).\n\n2.  **וְרָדַ֣ף אַחֲרֵיהֶם֒** (and he will pursue them):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this might be a figurative expression for something other than literal pursuit.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward description of a physical action—Pharaoh and his army physically chasing after the Israelites. There is no indication of a deeper, non-literal meaning.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְאִכָּבְדָ֤ה בְּפַרְעֹה֙ וּבְכׇל־חֵיל֔וֹ** (that I may gain glory through Pharaoh and all his host):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "gain glory" (כבד) might be a metaphor or idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Gaining glory" or "being glorified" is a direct statement of God\'s intention to demonstrate His power and sovereignty, leading to His honor and reputation being magnified. It describes a literal outcome of God\'s actions, where His divine nature is revealed and acknowledged. It is not a comparison or a non-literal expression.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְיָדְע֥וּ מִצְרַ֖יִם כִּֽי־אֲנִ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה** (and the Egyptians shall know that I am יהוה):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "know" might be used in a figurative sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This describes the Egyptians coming to a cognitive understanding or realization of God\'s identity and power. It is a literal statement about knowledge and recognition.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **וַיַּֽעֲשׂוּ־כֵֽן** (And they did so):\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this narrative statement of action might be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard, literal narrative statement indicating that the preceding command or prediction was carried out.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The phrase "וַיֵּהָפֵךְ לְבַב" (literally "the heart was turned/changed") is a well-established idiomatic expression signifying a change of mind, attitude, or intention. It is not a literal physical turning of the organ. Therefore, it clearly falls under the category of a "biblical idiom or set phrase" as per the instructions. Furthermore, the use of "heart" to represent the mind or will is a form of metonymy, where a physical part (heart) stands for a related abstract concept (mind/will). Since the instructions allow for a phrase to be multiple types (e.g., both idiom and metonymy), I have classified it as both.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** While "heart" is metonymic, the entire phrase "change of heart" functions as a fixed idiom. The primary classification is "idiom" as per the specific instruction for biblical idioms, but the underlying mechanism for "heart" is metonymy.\n4.  **וַיֹּֽאמְרוּ֙** (and said): This is standard narrative language describing an action (speaking).

In the context of a chariot, it refers to the direct action of harnessing the horses to the chariot or otherwise making it ready for use. The English translation "ordered" implies a command, which is a literal action. Whether interpreted as a direct physical action of harnessing or a command to have it prepared, the phrase describes a straightforward, literal action of the character. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an obvious simile.

This is a common and literal usage of the word in such narrative contexts, not a figurative substitution.

The accompanying English note states: "officers Heb. shalish; originally \'third man on royal chariot\'; hence \'adjutant,\' \'officer.\'" This etymological explanation strongly suggests a figurative origin.\n    *   Reasoning: The term שָׁלִשׁ (shalish) literally means "third" or "third man." It originated from the specific role of the "third man" on a three-man chariot crew, who was typically a high-ranking adjutant or officer. Over time, this specific role became generalized to refer to any high-ranking military officer. This is a classic example of **synecdoche**, which is a type of metonymy, where a specific part or role ("the third man") stands in for the broader class of individuals ("military officers") who hold similar authority or function. Even if it became a conventional term for "officer," its origin and the way it refers to a class of people via a specific historical role makes it figurative.\n    *   Borderline cases: One might argue that by the time of this text, שָׁלִשׁ had become a fully lexicalized, non-figurative term for "officer." However, the explicit note in the translation highlighting its origin as "third man" and its subsequent meaning "adjutant, officer" points to its metonymic/synecdochic nature. The term is not literally "the third man" in every chariot, but rather a title derived from that specific, historically significant role. Therefore, I classify it as metonymy/synecdoche.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

I also considered the divine anthropomorphism of "יהוה stiffened."\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew, the "heart" (לֵב) is consistently understood as the seat of intellect, will, and emotions, not merely the physical organ. Therefore, "stiffening the heart" is a well-established biblical idiom that describes making someone resolute, stubborn, or unyielding in their disposition or decision. While it has metaphorical roots (comparing the will to a physical object that can be stiffened) and metonymic aspects (heart representing will), the phrase functions as a single, conventional expression for a psychological state. As per the instructions, biblical idioms and set phrases are to be classified as "idiom." The action of "יהוה stiffened" is considered a literal divine action in the ANE context, as it does not refer to a physical body part of God.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** I debated whether to break this down into separate metonymy and metaphor components. However, given the explicit instruction to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type, treating the entire phrase as a single idiom is the most appropriate and conservative approach.\n\n2.  **Phrase/Concept:** "וַיִּרְדֹּ֕ף אַחֲרֵ֖י בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל" / "and he gave chase to the Israelites"\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "gave chase" (רדף אחרי) could be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase describes a straightforward, literal physical action of pursuit.

It signifies acting with boldness, defiance, power, or openly, rather than referring to a literal physical raising of hands. It is a set phrase describing the manner of an action. As per the instructions, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom."\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** Similar to "stiffened the heart," I considered analyzing it as metonymy plus metaphor, but the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type led to classifying the entire phrase as an idiom.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It is common in narrative to refer to the people of a nation when describing their collective actions, especially military ones. There is no clear substitution of one concept for another in a figurative sense; it\'s a straightforward description of the actors.

It is not a case where a part stands in for the whole in a way that implies a figurative meaning beyond the literal components mentioned. It\'s a comprehensive, literal description of the military might.

However, in geographical contexts, it is a well-established idiom to refer to an "opening," "entrance," "pass," or "edge" of a location (e.g., mouth of a river, mouth of a cave, mouth of a sword). "Pi-hahiroth" is a place name incorporating this idiomatic usage. The instructions explicitly state that "Biblical idioms and set phrases" should be classified as "idiom" type, providing "לְפִי־חָֽרֶב" (mouth of the sword) as an example, which is structurally analogous. This is a clear instance where a human body part (mouth) is used to describe a non-human, non-living geographical feature\'s opening.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue that such common geographical idioms become lexicalized and lose their figurative force. However, given the explicit instruction to classify biblical idioms and set phrases, and the clear cross-domain comparison (human body part to geographical feature), it is appropriately marked as an idiom.\n\n5.  **לִפְנֵ֖י בַּ֥עַל צְפֹֽן** (before Baal-zephon):\n    *   **Considered:** If "before Baal-zephon" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal spatial description, indicating the location relative to a place name.

The phrase "נָשָׂא עֵינַיִם" (nasa einayim) is a very common and well-established biblical idiom meaning "to look up," "to look around," or "to observe/see." It functions as a conventional expression for the act of perceiving visually, rather than merely describing the physical movement of the eyeballs. The English translation "caught sight of" reflects this idiomatic usage. According to the instructions, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom." Therefore, I am marking this as an idiom.\n\n3.  **"וְהִנֵּ֥ה מִצְרַ֣יִם&thinsp;׀ נֹסֵ֣עַ אַחֲרֵיהֶ֗ם" (the Egyptians advancing upon them / lit.

Countries do not physically "journey" or "advance" in the manner described; it is the people or army of Egypt that performs these actions. This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche), where the name of the country stands for its inhabitants or military force. The English translation "the Egyptians" correctly interprets this figurative usage. I am marking this as metonymy.\n    *   **"נֹסֵ֣עַ אַחֲרֵיהֶ֗ם" (advancing upon them / lit.

The metonymy is in *who* is journeying, not the act of journeying itself.\n\n4.  **"וַיִּֽירְאוּ֙ מְאֹ֔ד" (Greatly frightened):** This is a straightforward, literal description of the Israelites\' emotional state.

No figurative language is present here.\n\n2.  **הֲֽמִבְּלִ֤י אֵין־קְבָרִים֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם** (Was it for want of graves in Egypt?): I considered if "want of graves" or the rhetorical question itself might be figurative. The phrase literally asks if there is a lack of burial places in Egypt. While the question is rhetorical and expresses sarcasm, anger, and accusation, the underlying concept of "graves" and "lack" is literal. It is not a metaphor (graves are not likened to something else), nor is it personification. It\'s a direct, albeit emotionally charged, statement about a perceived condition. Therefore, I am not marking this as figurative.\n\n3.  **לְקַחְתָּ֖נוּ לָמ֣וּת בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר** (that you brought us to die in the wilderness?): I considered if "to die in the wilderness" could be figurative, perhaps hyperbole for extreme hardship.

However, in this context, "the thing" refers directly and literally to the specific statement or matter they had previously communicated. It is a straightforward reference to the content of their complaint, not a figurative substitution of a part for a whole or an abstract concept for a concrete one.

However, this is standard, literal language for the act of speaking or communicating. It conveys its meaning directly without relying on figurative imagery or an established idiomatic meaning distinct from its literal components.

While it is a common expression, its meaning is direct and literal: "cease from us" or "stop bothering us." It functions as a direct command and does not employ figurative language. Therefore, it is not an idiom.\n\n4.  **וְנַֽעַבְדָ֣ה אֶת־מִצְרָ֑יִם** (and we will serve the Egyptians): I considered if "serve" (עֲבֹד) could be a euphemism or metaphor for a different kind of subservience or hardship.

It is a direct and accurate description of their historical condition and the alternative they are proposing.

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **"the Egyptians whom you see today" (אֶת־מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ הַיּ֔וֹם):** I considered if "the Egyptians" (מִצְרַ֙יִם֙) is used figuratively. The Israelites are literally seeing the Egyptian army pursuing them, not the entire population of Egypt. Moses uses the broader term "the Egyptians" (referring to the whole nation or people) to specifically denote the military force (a part of that nation) that is currently threatening them. This is a classic example of synecdoche, where the whole stands for a part. Synecdoche is a type of metonymy. While this usage is common in narrative language, the explicit inclusion of "metonymy" as a classification type in the instructions indicates that such referential shifts should be identified. It is not a clear metaphor, obvious simile, or personification, but it is a distinct rhetorical device. Therefore, I have marked it as metonymy.\n\n6.  **"you will never see again" (לֹ֥א תֹסִ֛פוּ לִרְאֹתָ֥ם ע֖וֹד עַד־עוֹלָֽם):** This is a literal statement predicting a future cessation of encounters with the specific Egyptian force. The phrase "never again" (עַד־עוֹלָֽם) is a literal expression of duration. There is no figurative language present.

It is a literal instruction regarding their physical and verbal behavior – to remain quiet and passive while YHWH acts on their behalf.

However, the command is for Moses to perform a literal physical action of lifting a tangible object. While the rod serves as an instrument of divine power and a symbol of authority in the broader narrative, the action described here is a direct, physical instruction. Therefore, it is not figurative in this context.\n\n2.  **וּנְטֵ֧ה אֶת־יָדְךָ֛ (and hold out your arm/hand)**: I considered if "arm/hand" might be a metonymy for Moses\' action or influence. Similar to the rod, this is a literal command for Moses to extend his physical arm. It describes a direct bodily action. The text does not use the arm to represent something else, but rather as the literal means by which Moses performs the commanded action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **עַל־הַיָּ֖ם (over the sea)**: This is a literal prepositional phrase indicating the spatial relationship between Moses\' arm and the sea. It is a straightforward description of location. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **וּבְקָעֵ֑הוּ (and split it)**: This refers to the action of splitting the sea. I considered if this verb, בָּקַע (baqa\'), when applied to a body of water, might be a metaphor, personification, or hyperbole, as "splitting" is more commonly associated with solid objects (like wood or rock) or breaking open something (like a womb or a city wall). However, the narrative describes a miraculous event where the sea literally parts. The text presents this as a direct, physical action performed by divine power through Moses, resulting in a literal division of the water. It does not compare the sea to something else that splits, nor does it attribute human qualities to the sea. The language is descriptive of an extraordinary, yet literal, physical occurrence within the narrative\'s reality. Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and character actions, and to interpret divine anthropomorphisms (and by extension, divine actions on creation) literally unless they refer to God\'s body, this is understood as a literal description of a miraculous event. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **וְיָבֹ֧אוּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל (so that the Israelites may march/go)**: This describes the literal movement of the Israelites. It is a straightforward account of their action.

It functions as a metonymy where the physical heart stands for the will/mind, and it also contains a metaphorical element where the abstract concept of will is treated as a physical entity that can be made stiff. Following the instruction to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, I will mark this as an idiom.

If interpreted this way ("and it lit up the night"), it would describe a miraculous but literal action of the cloud/darkness providing light, and thus not be figurative. However, the provided English translation includes a footnote explicitly offering an alternative interpretation from the root ארר (’-r-r), meaning "to cast a spell" or "curse." Analyzing the text *as provided*, including its interpretive notes, this alternative meaning must be considered.\n    *   If "cast a spell upon the night" is adopted, then "the night" (הַלָּ֑יְלָה), an abstract concept of time or condition, is being treated as an entity that can be subjected to a "spell." "Casting a spell" is an action typically performed by an intelligent agent (e.g., a person, a deity) and implies a supernatural manipulation or influence. By attributing this action to the cloud and darkness (non-human entities) and directing it towards "the night," the text personifies both the agent (cloud/darkness acting with agency) and the object (night being susceptible to a spell). This is a clear instance of personification, where an inanimate concept is given the capacity to be supernaturally acted upon, and non-human entities are given the capacity to perform such an action.\n    *   Borderline case debate: The primary Masoretic reading of וַיָּ֖אֶר from אור ("to light") would render this non-figurative.

There is no indication that "holding out his arm" carries a meaning beyond the literal extension of his limb as a command or sign.

According to the guidelines, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." Since "drove back" is an action and not a reference to a specific body part of God, it is interpreted literally as God\'s direct intervention.\n        *   **Reasoning for exclusion (b):** The verb וַיּוֹלֶךְ (from ה.ל.ךְ in the Hiphil stem) means "to cause to go, to lead, to drive." Here, God causes the sea to go back using the strong east wind. The sea is the direct object of the action, meaning it is being acted upon, not acting with its own agency. This is a description of a physical displacement of the water mass. It does not attribute human-like qualities, emotions, or volitional actions to the sea (e.g., the sea did not "flee" or "retreat" of its own accord). Therefore, it is not personification.\n        *   **Borderline cases:** This phrase was the most borderline. The potential for personification of the sea was carefully considered. However, the grammatical structure and the meaning of the verb indicate the sea as the passive recipient of an action, rather than an active agent.\n    *   **בְּר֨וּחַ קָדִ֤ים עַזָּה֙** (with a strong east wind) and **כׇּל־הַלַּ֔יְלָה** (all that night)\n        *   **Considered:** These are literal descriptions of the means and duration of the event.\n        *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** No figurative elements are present.\n        *   **Borderline cases:** None.\n\n3.  **וַיָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת־הַיָּ֖ם לֶחָרָבָ֑ה** (and turned the sea into dry ground)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "turned the sea into dry ground" could be a metaphor for a drastic, transformative change, or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** This is a literal description of a physical transformation. The water receded, revealing the seabed as dry ground.

This is a direct identification of the waters *as* a wall, not merely "like a wall" (which would typically use the comparative particle כְּ). A wall (חוֹמָה) is a man-made structure designed for defense, enclosure, or separation. The waters, a natural element, are described as embodying the function and form of such a structure. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where the waters are the target and a wall is the vehicle, highlighting their function as a protective barrier. This is a strong metaphor.\n    *   Borderline cases: One might argue it\'s a very vivid literal description of a miraculous event, but the identification of water *as* a wall, rather than merely *acting like* one, pushes it firmly into the realm of metaphor. Water does not inherently possess the structural properties of a wall; it is given this quality by divine action, and the description uses figurative language to convey this.\n\n3.  **מִֽימִינָ֖ם וּמִשְּׂמֹאלָֽם** (on their right and on their left):\n    *   Considered if this spatial description could be an idiom or a form of merism.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a straightforward, literal description of location. "On their right and on their left" simply indicates that the walls of water flanked the Israelites on both sides.

It is a standard temporal marker, not a figurative expression or an idiom with a non-literal meaning.\n2.  **וַיַּשְׁקֵ֤ף יְהֹוָה֙ / יהוה looked down**: I considered if "יהוה looked down" is an anthropomorphism. According to the instructions, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

Thus, this is a literal description of God\'s intervention.\n    *   Considered "בְּמִצְרָֽיִם" (against Egypt) as potential personification or metonymy.\n    *   Reasoning: Similar to point 3, "Egypt" here refers to the Egyptian people or army against whom Yahweh is fighting, not the geographical land itself.

This is marked as metonymy.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The text describes a direct, observable gesture, not a symbolic representation of his power or a part standing for the whole. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיָּ֨שׇׁב הַיָּ֜ם לִפְנ֥וֹת בֹּ֙קֶר֙ לְאֵ֣יתָנ֔וֹ** (and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state):\n    *   Considered: If "the sea returned" (וַיָּ֨שׇׁב הַיָּ֜ם) could be personification, attributing agency to the sea.\n    *   Reasoning: The verb שׁוּב (shuv) means "to return" or "turn back." In the context of water, this describes the natural physical process of receding or flowing back to its previous state or location. While the sea is inanimate, its "returning" is a description of its physical movement and restoration, not an attribution of conscious will or human-like action. The phrase "to its normal state" (לְאֵ֣יתָנ֔וֹ) further reinforces this as a natural physical phenomenon. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **וּמִצְרַ֖יִם נָסִ֣ים לִקְרָאת֑וֹ** (and the Egyptians fled at its approach):\n    *   Considered: If "at its approach" (לִקְרָאת֑וֹ), referring to the sea, constitutes personification.\n    *   Reasoning: The prepositional phrase לִקְרָאת (liqrat) means "to meet," "towards," or "at the approach of." The suffix וֹ refers to הַיָּם (the sea). Describing the sea as "approaching" (or having an "approach") attributes an active, intentional movement or agency to an inanimate body of water. The sea is not literally "approaching" in a human-like manner, but its movement is described as if it were a living entity pursuing or confronting the Egyptians. This is a clear instance of personification.\n\n4.  **וַיְנַעֵ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־מִצְרַ֖יִם בְּת֥וֹךְ הַיָּֽם** (But יהוה hurled the Egyptians into the sea):\n    *   Considered: If "יהוה hurled the Egyptians" (וַיְנַעֵ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־מִצְרַ֖יִם) is a metaphor or hyperbole for God\'s action.\n    *   Reasoning: The verb נָעַר (na\'ar) means "to shake off," "to cast off," or "to hurl." This is an action attributed to God. According to the guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms describing actions (e.g., God went, God was angry, God fought) are considered literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s specific body parts. "Hurling" is an action, not a body part. Therefore, this is understood as a literal description of God\'s powerful and direct intervention, causing the Egyptians to be violently swept away or thrown into the sea. It is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In the context of water, this is a common and literal description of its movement, particularly when receding or reversing direction. For instance, in Genesis 8:3, the waters "receded" (וַיָּשֻׁ֥בוּ הַמַּ֖יִם) from the earth. In Exodus 14:26, God commands that the waters "come back" (וְיָשֻׁ֤בוּ הַמַּ֙יִם֙) upon the Egyptians.

The narrative aims to emphasize the completeness of the annihilation, not to exaggerate for rhetorical effect while implying some might have survived. This is a statement of absolute fact within the narrative\'s framework, consistent with the divine act described.

However, the accompanying English note explicitly states, "The poetic figure in vv. 1–4 takes ancient Near Eastern gender roles as a given: the (male) role of expert warrior represented salvation from military threats. See the Dictionary under “male metaphors for God.”" This note strongly indicates that God\'s triumph, particularly its "glorious" nature, is being understood and expressed metaphorically through the lens of a human expert warrior\'s victory. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison (God\'s divine power/victory likened to a human warrior\'s triumph), making it a metaphor. The note\'s explicit guidance on "poetic figure" and "male metaphors for God" overrides a strict, narrow interpretation of the anthropomorphism rule in this specific context, as it points to a conceptual comparison rather than just a literal divine action.\n\n4.  **Phrase: ס֥וּס וְרֹכְב֖וֹ (Horse and driver)**\n    *   Considered: If this phrase is a form of metonymy or synecdoche.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase "horse and driver" (or "horse and its rider") is clearly not referring to a single, literal horse and driver.

Instead, this phrase identifies God as the *source* and *embodiment* of the speaker\'s strength. This is a classic cross-domain comparison where an abstract quality (strength) is used to describe God\'s essential nature and role for the speaker.

The Hebrew זִמְרָה primarily means "song" or "melody," and secondarily can imply "praise" or "strength" in poetic contexts. Assuming "song" as the primary meaning here, as it offers a distinct figurative comparison from "strength."\n    *   **Reasoning:** God is not literally a musical composition or a sound. This phrase identifies God as the *object*, *source*, and *content* of the speaker\'s praise and joy, which is expressed through song. It\'s a metaphorical identification, signifying that God *is* the very reason and expression of the speaker\'s worship. Therefore, it is a metaphor.\n\n3.  **"וַֽיְהִי־לִ֖י לִֽישׁוּעָ֑ה" (He is become my deliverance)**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether this is a literal statement of function/identity or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to "my strength" and "my song," God is not literally an abstract concept of "deliverance." Rather, God is identified as the *source* and *embodiment* of the deliverance experienced by the speaker. This is a metaphorical statement where an abstract noun (deliverance) is used to describe God\'s active role and essential nature in providing salvation.

The action refers to the speaker\'s intention to honor, glorify, and give supreme importance to God, making Him "beautiful" or "glorious" through praise and worship.

My reasoning for including it as figurative despite God\'s role as a warrior is that the text uses a direct identification ("Yahweh *is* a man of war") rather than a simile ("Yahweh is *like* a man of war"). The use of "אִישׁ" (man) to describe God, who is not human, constitutes a cross-domain comparison, making it a clear metaphor.

Attributing the action of "consuming" (`יֹאכְלֵ֖מוֹ`) to fury is a clear instance of personification, giving an abstract entity the capacity for an action typically performed by a living being or a destructive force like fire. This is a cross-domain comparison (abstract concept acting like a destructive force). I included this as personification.\n\n5.  **"like straw" (כַּקַּֽשׁ)**: I considered if this is a simile. The explicit use of the comparative particle `כַּ` (like/as) clearly indicates a direct comparison. The opponents are likened to straw, emphasizing their vulnerability and the ease with which they are destroyed by God\'s fury. This is an obvious simile. I included this as a simile.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While "nostrils" (אַפֶּ֙יךָ֙) is a body part, the phrase "blast of Your nostrils" (רוּחַ אַפֶּ֙יךָ֙) is a well-established biblical idiom for divine anger, powerful breath, or overwhelming divine power, particularly in contexts of judgment or miraculous intervention (e.g., Exodus 15:8, 2 Samuel 22:16, Psalm 18:15). It\'s not merely a literal description of God\'s physical breathing, but rather the powerful, often destructive, *effect* associated with it.

The `נפש` here functions as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche) for the speaker\'s entire being, their inner self, or their appetite/desire. It\'s not that the `נפש` itself is an independent agent acting, but rather that the speaker\'s desire, represented by `נפש`, will be completely satisfied.

However, the guidelines explicitly state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God\'s actions, God\'s anger) are to be treated as LITERAL in the ANE context, unless they refer to God\'s body parts like "God\'s finger." "Your wind" (רוּחֲךָ֖) can refer to God\'s breath, which is an anthropomorphism. In this context, God causing wind to blow is an action attributed to God, which falls under the category of anthropomorphisms to be interpreted literally.

While water can be literally powerful and awe-inspiring, the term "majestic" typically attributes a quality of grandeur, nobility, or regal presence often associated with conscious, powerful beings (like kings or deities). Applying this term to an inanimate natural entity like water elevates its description beyond mere physical power to a status of profound, almost conscious, grandeur.

These are literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function, not figurative similes." This rhetorical question, while emphasizing God\'s unparalleled uniqueness, functions as a literal assertion of God\'s singular status and attributes among other powerful beings ("בָּֽאֵלִם֙" / "among the celestials"). Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.

In biblical Hebrew, the "hand of God" or "right hand of God" is a well-established metonymy for God\'s power, strength, or active intervention, rather than a literal physical limb. God is not understood to possess a physical hand in the human sense. Therefore, the action of "putting out Your right hand" signifies the exertion of God\'s power or direct intervention.

Attributing the action of "swallowing" (תִּבְלָעֵ֖מוֹ) to the earth is a clear instance of personification, where a non-human entity is given human-like capabilities. This vivid imagery describes the complete disappearance or destruction of the "them" (the enemies) into the ground, as if consumed.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None.

My reasoning is that "lead" is a standard, literal description of God\'s guidance and direction of Israel, particularly in the context of the Exodus and wilderness journey. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison or personification. "In Your love" describes the motivation or manner of leading, not a figurative element itself. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"עַם־ז֣וּ גָּאָ֑לְתָּ" (the people You redeemed):** I considered if the verb "redeemed" (גָּאַל) was figurative. My reasoning is that "redeem" here refers to God\'s historical and theological act of delivering Israel from slavery in Egypt. While the term has roots in legal and economic transactions, in this biblical context, it is a literal description of God\'s salvific action for His people. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"נֵהַ֥לְתָּ בְעׇזְּךָ֖" (You guide in Your strength):** I considered if the verb "guide" (נָהַל) when applied to God\'s action, or the phrase "in Your strength," constituted figurative language. Similar to "lead," "guide" is a literal description of God\'s active direction and care for His people. "In Your strength" describes the power by which God guides, not a figurative element. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n4.  **"אֶל־נְוֵ֥ה קׇדְשֶֽׁךָ" (to Your holy abode):** I considered if "abode" (נָוֶה) when referring to God\'s dwelling place, is figurative. While "נָוֶה" can literally mean a dwelling or habitation, when applied to God, an omnipresent being, it cannot refer to a physical house in which God literally resides like a human. Instead, "Your holy abode" refers to the sanctuary, the Temple, or the promised land as the chosen place where God\'s presence is uniquely manifested among His people. This is a cross-domain comparison where God\'s divine presence or chosen dwelling place is likened to a human dwelling place. It is a metaphorical representation of God\'s relationship with His people and His chosen sacred space. Therefore, I am including it as a metaphor.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in narrative contexts, "peoples" (עַמִּים) often refers literally to the general populace or nations. There is no clear indication here that it stands for something other than the peoples themselves. Thus, I concluded this is a literal statement.\n\n2.  **"יִרְגָּז֑וּן" (they tremble):** I considered if "tremble" might be hyperbole or a metaphor for extreme fear. However, trembling is a common, literal physical and emotional reaction to fear, shock, or distress. It is a direct description of their physical state and emotional response, not an exaggeration or a comparison to something else. Therefore, I concluded this is a literal description of an action/reaction.\n\n3.  **"חִ֣יל אָחַ֔ז" (Agony grips):** This phrase was the primary focus for figurative language.\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if this phrase constitutes personification or a metaphor. The Hebrew verb אָחַז (achaz) means "to seize, grasp, take hold of." The noun חִיל (chil) refers to "trembling, anguish, pain, travail, agony."\n    *   **Reasoning:** When an abstract, inanimate concept like "agony" (חִיל) is described as performing a physical action like "gripping" or "seizing" (אָחַז), it attributes human-like agency and capability to something that does not possess them. Agony itself does not have hands to grip; rather, it is a feeling that overwhelms or takes hold of a person. This attribution of a physical action to an abstract entity is a clear instance of personification. It is not a metaphor because agony is not being equated with something else that grips, but rather it is described as *acting* like an entity that can grip. It is not an idiom in the sense of a fixed, non-literal phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from its parts; rather, the figurative meaning arises directly from the personification of the verb\'s action.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue it\'s merely a strong verb choice to describe intense feeling. However, the verb אָחַז specifically implies a physical taking hold, which is incongruous with an abstract concept like agony unless personified. The vividness comes from this attribution of physical agency. Therefore, I included it as personification.\n\n4.  **"יֹשְׁבֵ֖י פְּלָֽשֶׁת" (the dwellers in Philistia):** This is a literal description of the inhabitants of a geographical region. No figurative language here.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "Agony grips" is identified as figurative language.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While the intensity might be high, it is within the realm of literal human experience and not an exaggeration beyond possibility or a comparison to another domain. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n    *   I considered if `אַלּוּפֵ֣י אֱד֔וֹם` ("clans/chiefs of Edom") was metonymy, where the leaders represent the entire nation.\n    *   Reasoning: `אַלּוּפֵי` directly refers to the prominent figures or groups within Edom. This is a literal designation of a social/political entity, not a figurative representation where a part stands for a whole in a non-literal sense. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **אֵילֵ֣י מוֹאָ֔ב** (The tribes of Moab / The chiefs of Moab)\n    *   I considered if `אֵילֵ֣י` ("rams" or "chiefs") was a metaphor for leaders, likening them to strong animals.\n    *   Reasoning: The Hebrew word `אֵיל` has multiple meanings, including "ram" (animal) and "chief" or "leader," especially in contexts referring to prominent figures of a nation (e.g., Ex 15:15, Ezek 17:13). Given the parallelism with `אַלּוּפֵי אֱדֹם` (chiefs of Edom) and `יֹשְׁבֵי כְנָעַן` (dwellers of Canaan), the most conservative and contextually appropriate reading is that `אֵילֵי מוֹאָב` refers literally to the leaders or prominent figures of Moab. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **יֹֽאחֲזֵ֖מוֹ רָ֑עַד** (trembling grips them)\n    *   I considered if this phrase constituted personification.\n    *   Reasoning: `רָ֑עַד` (trembling/shaking) is an abstract physical and emotional state. The verb `יֹֽאחֲזֵ֖מוֹ` ("it grips/seizes them") attributes a human-like action (the ability to physically grip or seize) to this abstract concept. This is a clear instance of personification.\n    *   This phrase is marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **נָמֹ֕גוּ** (are aghast / melted away)\n    *   I considered if this verb was a metaphor.\n    *   Reasoning: The verb `נָמֹג` literally means "to melt" or "to dissolve." When applied to people, as it is here, it is not meant literally that their physical bodies are melting. Instead, it metaphorically describes their courage, resolve, or strength dissolving, or their bodies becoming weak and limp due to extreme fear or terror. The English "are aghast" captures the emotional effect but loses the original metaphorical image of melting. This is a clear metaphor.\n    *   This phrase is marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **כֹּ֖ל יֹשְׁבֵ֥י כְנָֽעַן** (All the dwellers in Canaan)\n    *   I considered if this was synecdoche (e.g., "dwellers" representing the entire nation).\n    *   Reasoning: "Dwellers" is a direct and literal description of the inhabitants of Canaan. It refers to the people who live there, not a part representing a whole in a figurative sense. It is a straightforward demographic description. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The verb נָפַל (to fall, descend) is applied to abstract emotions (terror and dread).\n    *   **Reasoning:** While this attributes a physical action (falling) to non-physical entities, it is a highly conventional and common expression in Biblical Hebrew to describe the overwhelming onset of fear or other emotions (e.g., "sleep fell upon him," "a spirit fell upon him"). It functions as a standard idiom for an emotion seizing or overcoming someone. Given the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type and to be conservative with standard narrative language, this is best categorized as an idiom rather than a novel personification or metaphor. It\'s a fixed expression.\n\n2.  **"בִּגְדֹ֥ל זְרוֹעֲךָ֖" (Through the might of Your arm)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "Your arm" (זְרוֹעֲךָ) is a literal reference to God\'s physical arm or a figurative representation of His power.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instruction explicitly states that divine anthropomorphisms referring to God\'s body (like "God\'s finger") should be marked as figurative. "God\'s arm" falls into this category. It is not meant to be understood as a literal physical limb, but rather as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part stands for the whole or an attribute) for God\'s strength, power, and active intervention. The arm is the instrument of power and action.\n\n3.  **"יִדְּמ֣וּ כָּאָ֑בֶן" (they are still as stone)**\n    *   **Considered:** If this comparison is a literal statement or a simile.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The presence of the comparative particle כְּ (like, as) explicitly marks this as a simile. The enemies\' state of being "still" or "motionless" (יִדְּמוּ) is directly compared to the inertness and immobility of a "stone" (אָבֶן). This is a clear, direct comparison using a comparative particle.\n\n4.  **"עַד־יַעֲבֹ֤ר עַמְּךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה" (Till Your people cross over, יהוה)** and **"עַֽד־יַעֲבֹ֖ר עַם־ז֥וּ קָנִֽיתָ" (Till Your people cross whom You have ransomed)**\n    *   **Considered:** If "cross over" (יַעֲבֹר) or "ransomed" (קָנִיתָ) are figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Cross over" refers to the literal historical event of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea or the Jordan River. "Ransomed" describes God\'s act of deliverance from slavery in Egypt. While "ransom" can have metaphorical extensions, in this context, it refers to a concrete act of liberation and acquisition by God, which is a foundational theological concept but not a figurative comparison in the sense of a metaphor or simile. It describes a divine action and relationship, not a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, these are not marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"In her hand" is a literal description of where the drum was held, indicating direct physical contact and possession in that moment. There is no indication of a deeper, non-literal meaning akin to an idiom like "in the hand of God." The drum is a literal object used in the described activity.

I reasoned that in the context of the Exodus narrative, where an entire army was destroyed, "horse and driver" functions as a synecdoche (a type of metonymy) to represent the entire Egyptian cavalry or military force.

The instructions state to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Standard narrative language" and such usage is a common and literal way to refer to the people of Israel in biblical narrative, not a figurative device intended to evoke a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal meaning. The action of Moses causing them to set out is also a literal, historical action.\n\n2.  **מִיַּם־ס֔וּף** (from the Sea of Reeds):\n    *   I considered if "Sea of Reeds" (יַּם־ס֔וּף) could have any symbolic or figurative meaning beyond its literal geographical designation.\n    *   My reasoning is that this is a literal geographical location. There is no indication of any figurative meaning in this context.\n\n3.  **וַיֵּצְא֖וּ אֶל־מִדְבַּר־שׁ֑וּר** (They went on into the wilderness of Shur):\n    *   I considered if "wilderness of Shur" (מִדְבַּר־שׁ֑וּר) could carry any symbolic weight or if the act of "going on" (וַיֵּצְא֖וּ) was anything other than a literal movement.\n    *   My reasoning is that "wilderness of Shur" is a literal geographical location, and the verb "went on" describes a literal action.

However, in this narrative context, it describes a literal physical journey and arrival at a geographical location. This is standard narrative language describing a character action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"וְלֹ֣א יָֽכְל֗וּ לִשְׁתֹּ֥ת מַ֙יִם֙ מִמָּרָ֔ה" (but they could not drink the water of Marah)**: This describes a literal inability to perform an action due to the quality of the water. There is no hidden meaning or symbolic representation here. It is a straightforward statement of fact within the narrative. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"כִּ֥י מָרִ֖ים הֵ֑ם" (because it was bitter)**: This is the most critical phrase to examine. I considered if "bitter" (מָרִים) could be a metaphor for something unpleasant, difficult, or sorrowful, as "bitter" is often used figuratively in other contexts (e.g., "bitter experience," "bitter tears"). However, the immediate context specifies "the water of Marah" and the inability to "drink" it. Water can be literally bitter in taste due to mineral content or other impurities, making it undrinkable. The subsequent naming of the place "Marah" (meaning "bitter") directly stems from this literal, physical quality of the water. The footnote "Marah I.e., \'bitter.\'" further confirms this direct, literal meaning. Therefore, "bitter" here describes a literal taste quality of the water, not a figurative cross-domain comparison.\n\n4.  **"עַל־כֵּ֥ן קָרָֽא־שְׁמָ֖הּ מָרָֽה" (that is why it was named Marah)**: This is a literal explanation for the origin of the place name.

However, this is a literal description of an action—Moses vocally appealing to God. It falls under standard narrative language and character action, which are to be interpreted literally.\n\n2.  **וַיּוֹרֵ֤הוּ יְהֹוָה֙ עֵ֔ץ** (and יהוה showed him a piece of wood):\n    *   **וַיּוֹרֵ֤הוּ יְהֹוָה֙** (יהוה showed him): I considered this as a divine anthropomorphism. The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God showed) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to a specific body part of God (like "God\'s finger"). "Showed him" describes God\'s action or guidance, not a specific body part. Therefore, it is interpreted literally.\n    *   **עֵ֔ץ** (a piece of wood): This refers to a literal physical object.

However, in this narrative, it describes a literal, miraculous physical transformation of the water\'s taste from bitter to sweet. While miraculous, it is presented as a literal event, not a figurative comparison.\n\n5.  **שָׁ֣ם שָׂ֥ם ל֛וֹ חֹ֥ק וּמִשְׁפָּ֖ט** (There [God] made for them a fixed rule): I considered if "made for them a fixed rule" (חֹק וּמִשְׁפָּט) could be figurative. The verb שָׂם (sam) means "to put, place, set, establish," and חֹק וּמִשְׁפָּט is a common biblical idiom/set phrase referring to laws, statutes, or ordinances. While a set phrase, it literally refers to the establishment of actual laws. The guidelines state to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, but this phrase, though a set phrase, is not figurative; it directly denotes the literal establishment of legal principles.

However, in biblical theology, God "testing" (נִסָּה) His people is a literal divine action intended to prove their obedience, reveal their hearts, or strengthen their faith. It is a direct description of a divine-human interaction and experience, not a figurative comparison of that experience to something else. It is a literal theological concept and action.\n\n**Borderline Cases Debated:**\nThe phrase "וְשָׁ֥ם נִסָּֽהוּ" (there they were put to the test) was the closest to being considered figurative. I debated if "test" could be a metaphor for a trial or ordeal. However, given the conservative instructions and the common theological understanding of God\'s testing in the Bible, it is understood as a literal divine action with a specific purpose (to prove, to reveal, to strengthen), rather than a metaphorical comparison. The experience *is* the test, not *like* a test.\n\nBased on this thorough analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, I find no elements in this verse that qualify as clear metaphors, personification, or obvious similes.

My reasoning for excluding it is that this is a grammatical construction used for emphasis, intensifying the verb "to hear/listen," but it does not create a cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiom in itself. It is a literal intensification of the act of hearing.\n\n2.  **"לְק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֣ה" (ləqōl YHWH) - "to the voice of YHWH"**: I considered if this phrase was a literal anthropomorphism or an idiom. The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms are literal unless they refer to God\'s body (e.g., "God\'s finger"). While "voice" is an attribute of a physical body, the guidelines also explicitly list "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (pi YHWH - mouth of YHWH) as an example of an idiom. "קול יהוה" (qol YHWH - voice of YHWH) functions very similarly to "פי יהוה" in many biblical contexts, referring to God\'s authoritative communication, command, or word, rather than a literal physical sound from a physical mouth. Therefore, I classify it as a biblical idiom for God\'s communication or command.\n\n3.  **"וְהַיָּשָׁ֤ר בְּעֵינָיו֙ תַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה" (wəhayyāšār bəʿêynāyw taʿaśeh) - "doing what is upright in God’s sight" / "what is right in His eyes you shall do"**: I considered if "בְּעֵינָיו֙" (bəʿêynāyw) - "in His eyes" was a literal anthropomorphism or figurative. My reasoning for including it as figurative is based directly on the guidelines: "Divine anthropomorphisms... are LITERAL... unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Eyes" are explicitly part of God\'s body. Therefore, "in His eyes" is not to be taken literally as God having physical eyes that see in a human way. It is an idiom for God\'s judgment, approval, or perspective.\n\n4.  **"וְהַֽאֲזַנְתָּ֙ לְמִצְוֺתָ֔יו" (wəhaʾăzanta ləmiṣwōtāyw) - "giving ear to God’s commandments"**: I considered if "giving ear" was a literal action or an idiom for obedience. My reasoning for including it as figurative is that while "to give ear" (האזין) literally means to listen, in the context of "commandments," it extends beyond mere physical hearing to imply attentive listening that leads to obedience. This is a common biblical idiom where the physical act of hearing or listening stands metonymically for the act of obeying or heeding.\n\n5.  **"וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֖ כׇּל־חֻקָּ֑יו" (wəšāmarta kol-ḥuqqāyw) - "and keeping all God’s laws"**: I considered if "keeping laws" was figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that "to keep" (שמר) in this context means to observe, guard, or obey laws, which is a literal action. It is not a figurative expression.\n\n6.  **"כׇּֽל־הַמַּחֲלָ֞ה אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֤מְתִּי בְמִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לֹא־אָשִׂ֣ים עָלֶ֔יךָ" (kol-hammaḥălâ ʾăšer-śamtî bəmiṣrayim lōʾ-ʾāśîm ʿāleyḵā) - "I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians"**: I considered if "I placed/put diseases" was figurative. My reasoning for excluding it is that this describes God\'s direct action of causing or inflicting diseases, which is presented as a literal divine action in the narrative. It is not a figurative expression.\n\n7.  **"כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה רֹפְאֶֽךָ" (kî ʾănî YHWH rōfʾeḵā) - "for I יהוה am your healer."**: I considered if "God is your healer" was a metaphor. My reasoning for including it as figurative is that God is not literally a human physician with medical tools or a medical profession. Instead, God performs the *function* of a healer by preventing or curing illness and providing health. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where God (the target) is likened to a healer (the vehicle) based on the shared quality of providing health and well-being.

However, this is a straightforward historical narrative describing a physical movement to a geographical location. There is no indication of a cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage. It is a literal statement of action and destination.\n\n2.  **"וְשָׁ֗ם שְׁתֵּ֥ים עֶשְׂרֵ֛ה עֵינֹ֥ת מַ֖יִם" (where there were twelve springs of water):** I considered if the number "twelve" or the "springs of water" might carry symbolic or figurative meaning beyond their literal count or nature. While numbers can sometimes be symbolic in biblical texts, in this immediate context, "twelve" appears to be a simple, factual enumeration of the springs present at Elim. "Springs of water" (עֵינֹ֥ת מַ֖יִם) is a literal description of a natural feature.

"Seventy" is a numerical count, and "palm trees" (תְּמָרִ֑ים) is a literal description of vegetation. Again, while numbers can have symbolic weight elsewhere, here it functions as a factual detail within the narrative. No figurative language is detected.\n\n4.  **"וַיַּחֲנוּ־שָׁ֖ם עַל־הַמָּֽיִם" (and they encamped there beside the water):** I considered if "encamped" or "beside the water" could be figurative. "Encamped" (וַיַּחֲנוּ) describes a literal action of setting up camp, and "beside the water" (עַל־הַמָּֽיִם) describes a literal location relative to the water source. This is standard narrative language describing a physical event. No figurative language is present.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis, this verse is entirely literal, providing factual details about the Israelites\' journey and the features of Elim.

It is standard narrative language for travel and does not carry an implied figurative meaning in this context.\n2.  **וַיָּבֹ֜אוּ כׇּל־עֲדַ֤ת** ("and the whole community came"):\n    *   Considered: If "community" (עֲדָה) could be a form of metonymy, where the collective noun stands in for the individual people comprising it.\n    *   Reasoning: While "community" refers to a group of people, it is a direct and literal term for such a collective in Hebrew. It functions as a precise descriptor of the assembled group rather than substituting an attribute or a closely associated concept for the people themselves. Therefore, it is not considered figurative.\n3.  **בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙** ("sons of Israel"):\n    *   Considered: If this phrase, literally "sons of Israel," is figurative, specifically an idiom or a form of synecdoche (a type of metonymy), given that it refers to the entire Israelite nation, including women and children, not just literal male offspring.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a well-established and conventional ethnonym in biblical Hebrew. While "sons" (בְּנֵי) literally denotes male offspring, the phrase "בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל" functions as a collective designation for the entire people of Israel, encompassing all its members regardless of gender. It is a fixed expression whose meaning extends beyond the literal sum of its parts when applied to the nation. Therefore, it is classified as an idiom. It\'s a borderline case between a literal description of descent and an idiom, but its consistent use to refer to the entire people (men, women, children) makes it function idiomatically rather than strictly literally.\n4.  **אֶל־מִדְבַּר־סִ֔ין** ("to the wilderness of Sin"):\n    *   Considered: If "wilderness" could be a metaphor for a period of hardship, testing, or spiritual barrenness.\n    *   Reasoning: In this context, "מִדְבַּר־סִין" is presented as a specific, literal geographical location, a desert region between Elim and Sinai. While wilderness experiences often carry symbolic weight in biblical narratives, the term itself here is used literally to denote a physical place.\n5.  **אֲשֶׁ֥ר בֵּין־אֵילִ֖ם וּבֵ֣ין סִינָ֑י** ("which is between Elim and Sinai"):\n    *   Considered: If the spatial relationship "between" could be used figuratively.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal geographical description, precisely locating the wilderness of Sin in relation to two other known places.

This is a direct, standard description of a vocal human action expressing dissatisfaction. While the act of grumbling often *indicates* rebellion or discontent, the word itself is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), a non-literal expression (idiom), or a personification. It describes the literal sound and act of complaining. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **`כׇּל־עֲדַ֧ת בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל` (kol-ʿăḏat bənê-yiśrāʾēl) - "the whole Israelite community"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "community" (עֲדָה) or "sons of Israel" (בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל) could be a form of metonymy or synecdoche (e.g., "sons" standing for the entire people).\n    *   **Reasoning**: `עֲדָה` (ʿăḏah) is a literal term for an assembly or congregation. `בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל` (bənê-yiśrāʾēl), meaning "sons of Israel," is the standard and literal ethnonym used throughout the Hebrew Bible to refer to the descendants of Jacob/Israel, i.e., the Israelite people. It is not a figurative part standing for a whole, but rather the established name for the collective group. The phrase as a whole is a literal description of the subject performing the action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **`עַל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְעַֽל־אַהֲרֹ֖ן` (ʿal-mōšeh wəʿal-ʾahărōn) - "against Moses and Aaron"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If the preposition `עַל` (ʿal), meaning "against" or "concerning," could be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning**: In this context, `עַל` functions literally to indicate the object or target of the complaint. It is a standard grammatical usage. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **`בַּמִּדְבָּֽר` (bammidbār) - "in the wilderness"**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "wilderness" (מִדְבָּר) could be a metaphor for a state of spiritual barrenness or a difficult situation.\n    *   **Reasoning**: `מִדְבָּר` (midbār) is a literal geographical term referring to a desert or uncultivated region. While the wilderness experience often carries theological significance in the biblical narrative, the word itself here denotes a physical location where the event occurred. It is not being used in a cross-domain comparison. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on a conservative analysis of standard narrative language, character actions, and the absence of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or biblical idioms as defined, no figurative language is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While "hand" is a body part, the phrase "by the hand of Yahweh" is a well-established biblical idiom that signifies divine agency, power, or direct intervention, rather than a literal physical hand. The guidelines explicitly state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, it is marked as an idiom. It could also be analyzed as metonymy (hand representing power), but the primary classification given the guidelines is "idiom."\n\n3.  **"בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם" (in the land of Egypt)**: This is a literal geographical reference. No figurative language was identified.\n\n4.  **"בְּשִׁבְתֵּ֙נוּ֙ עַל־סִ֣יר הַבָּשָׂ֔ר" (when we sat by the fleshpots)**:\n    *   **"עַל־סִ֣יר הַבָּשָׂ֔ר" (by the fleshpots)**: I considered if "fleshpots" or the act of "sitting by the fleshpots" was a literal description or a figurative one. While "fleshpots" are literal cooking vessels and "sitting by" is a literal action, in this context, the phrase is not merely about physical proximity to pots. It evokes the entire situation of having ample food, particularly meat, and the associated comfort and abundance that the Israelites experienced in Egypt. Thus, the "fleshpots" serve as a metonymy where the object (the cooking vessel) stands for the broader condition or state of affairs (the plentiful provisions and comfortable life).\n\n5.  **"בְּאׇכְלֵ֥נוּ לֶ֖חֶם לָשֹׂ֑בַע" (when we ate our fill of bread)**: This is a literal description of consuming enough food to be satisfied.

However, given the instruction to be conservative with character dialogue and the context of extreme distress and accusation, this is best understood as a literal expression of the Israelites\' genuine fear and their accusation of Moses and Aaron\'s perceived intent or the inevitable outcome of their leadership. It reflects their desperate state of mind and their belief in impending doom, rather than a rhetorical exaggeration meant to be understood as non-literal by an ANE audience. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The verb מַמְטִיר (mamṭir) means "to cause to rain." While bread does not typically "rain" in the same way water does, the biblical narrative describes the manna literally descending from the sky, covering the ground like dew or frost, and then being gathered as food. This is presented as a miraculous, yet literal, event where the substance (bread/manna) descends from the sky in a manner akin to rain. It is not a cross-domain comparison where bread is *likened* to something else, or the act of provision is *likened* to rain in a non-literal sense. Rather, it describes the *mechanism* of the miraculous provision. Therefore, I classify this as a literal description of a miraculous event, not figurative language.\n\n3.  **"וְיָצָ֨א הָעָ֤ם וְלָֽקְטוּ֙ דְּבַר־י֣וֹם בְּיוֹמ֔וֹ" (and the people shall go out and gather each day that day’s portion):** This is standard narrative language describing a physical action.

The verb הָלַךְ (halakh, "to walk") is frequently used in biblical Hebrew not just for physical locomotion, but also metaphorically to describe one\'s conduct, lifestyle, or adherence to a path, whether moral or spiritual. "Walking in Torah" (הלך בתורה) is a well-established biblical idiom meaning to obey, live according to, or adhere to God\'s instructions. This is a clear example of an idiom that functions as a metaphor, using physical movement to represent moral conduct.

However, the guidelines explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

The verb "behold" (וּרְאִיתֶם) implies a direct, literal perception of this manifestation. It is not likening God\'s presence to something else (thus, not a metaphor), nor is it a part standing for the whole or an attribute for the entity in a figurative sense (thus, not metonymy), but rather the direct object of perception. It is also not an idiom with a figurative meaning distinct from its literal components, but a theological term for a specific divine phenomenon.

My reasoning for excluding it is that while it is a rhetorical question, its meaning is quite direct and literal: "What is our significance/role/status in this situation?" It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or a fixed non-literal meaning that cannot be understood from its constituent words. It is not an idiom in the sense of the examples provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword").\n6.  **"לֹא־עָלֵ֥ינוּ תְלֻנֹּתֵיכֶ֖ם כִּ֥י עַל־יְהֹוָֽה" (Your grumbling is against YHWH, not against us!):** This is a literal statement clarifying the true target of the Israelites\' complaints.

While "פְנֵי" (face) is a human body part, in this context, it functions as a prepositional idiom indicating relational or authoritative proximity rather than a literal physical face of God. The instructions explicitly state that "פְנֵי הָאֲדָמָה" (face of the ground) is an idiom, and "לִפְנֵי יְהֹוָה" uses "פְנֵי" in a similar idiomatic manner to denote presence or authority. This is a figurative idiom.\n    *   Borderline cases: One might argue it\'s a divine anthropomorphism referring to God\'s "face" and thus literal according to the rule "unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." However, the pervasive idiomatic use of "לִפְנֵי" as a preposition meaning "before" or "in the presence of," combined with the explicit instruction to classify similar "פְנֵי" phrases as idioms, leads to the conclusion that this is an idiom for God\'s presence/authority, not a literal reference to a physical face.\n4.  **כִּ֣י שָׁמַ֔ע** (who has heard)\n    *   Considered: If God "hearing" is a divine anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: The instructions state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s specific body parts (e.g., "God\'s finger"). "Hearing" is a function or action, not a specific body part.

The instructions state: "Biblical idions and set phrases (e.g. לְפִי־חָֽרֶב, פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה,פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה) - these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type."\n    *   **Reasoning**: While `לֵּאמֹֽר` is a very common set phrase or discourse marker in Hebrew narrative, it does not carry a figurative meaning in the same way the examples provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground," "mouth of YHWH") do. Those examples involve a cross-domain comparison or personification (e.g., a sword having a "mouth," the ground having a "face," YHWH having a "mouth" in a metonymic sense for command). `לֵּאמֹֽר` simply introduces direct speech and literally means "to say" or "saying." It does not involve a non-literal interpretation or a conceptual mapping from one domain to another. Therefore, it is not a *figurative* idiom according to the provided guidelines and examples.\n\nBased on this analysis, no figurative language is present in this verse according to the specified conservative criteria.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Speak to them and say: By evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; and you shall know that I יהוה am your God.”), for figurative language according to the specified conservative guidelines.\n\n1.  **שָׁמַ֗עְתִּי** (I have heard):\n    *   **Considered:** Whether this divine anthropomorphism (God hearing) should be marked as figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The guidelines explicitly state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) are to be considered LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body in a specific, non-literal way (e.g., "God\'s finger"). "Hearing" is a perception, akin to "watching," and is understood as a literal attribute of God\'s awareness and responsiveness within the ANE worldview. It does not refer to a specific body part in a manner that would render it figurative (like "the arm of the Lord" for power). Therefore, I classify this as literal.\n\n2.  **תְּלוּנֹּת֮** (grumbling):\n    *   **Considered:** If "grumbling" could be a metaphor for a deeper, unspoken discontent, or a personification of the complaint itself.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "grumbling" is a direct and literal description of the audible complaints and expressions of dissatisfaction voiced by the Israelites. It is not being compared to another domain (e.g., "their grumbling was a storm"), nor is the act of grumbling endowed with human qualities beyond its inherent nature as a human expression. It serves as a straightforward report of their action. Therefore, I classify this as literal.\n\n3.  **בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵל֒** (sons of Israel / Israelites):\n    *   **Considered:** If this phrase constitutes an idiom or a metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Bnei Yisrael" is the standard, literal ethnonym and designation for the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and the collective people. It is not a figurative idiom in the sense of a set phrase with a non-literal meaning (like "mouth of the sword"), nor is it a metonymy where "sons" stands in for something else in a non-literal or symbolic way. It literally refers to the people. Therefore, I classify this as literal.\n\n4.  **תִּשְׂבְּעוּ־לָ֑חֶם** (you shall have your fill of bread):\n    *   **Considered:** If "have your fill" could be hyperbole or an idiom for complete satisfaction beyond merely eating.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase literally means to eat until one is satisfied or full. It is a direct description of the physical state of satiety after consuming bread. There is no exaggeration beyond the literal meaning of being full, nor is it a set phrase with a non-literal, figurative meaning. Therefore, I classify this as literal.\n\n5.  **וִֽידַעְתֶּ֕ם כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם** (and you shall know that I יהוה am your God):\n    *   **Considered:** If "know" could be a metaphor for experiencing or acknowledging in a non-literal sense, or if the entire statement is a theological idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Know" (ידעתם) here refers to a cognitive and experiential understanding and recognition of God\'s identity and power, which will be demonstrated through the miraculous provision of food. This is a literal statement about their future realization and acknowledgment, not a figurative comparison. The declaration "I YHWH am your God" is a fundamental theological truth and a literal assertion of God\'s identity and relationship with Israel, not a figurative idiom. Therefore, I classify this as literal.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, I find no instances of clear metaphors, obvious similes, personification, or figurative idioms in this verse.

However, for flying creatures, "to come up" or "to appear" is a standard, literal description of their arrival, often from the horizon or from a lower vantage point. It is standard narrative language describing a physical event. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n3.  **וַתְּכַ֖ס אֶת־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֑ה (vat-təḵas et-ham-maḥăneh) - "and covered the camp"**: I considered if "covered the camp" might be hyperbole or a metaphor. The narrative context (Exodus 16, Numbers 11) describes the quail appearing in immense quantities. If the quail were so numerous that they literally obscured the ground, then "covered" is a literal description of the physical reality. While it describes an extraordinary abundance, the text presents this as a factual, albeit miraculous, event. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor) nor an exaggeration for rhetorical effect beyond what the narrative intends as a factual description of the event\'s scale (hyperbole). The instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and character actions/divine anthropomorphisms (which implies a literal understanding of miraculous events) leads me to interpret this as a literal description of the physical extent of the quail\'s presence.\n4.  **וּבַבֹּ֗קֶר (uvabbaqer) - "in the morning"**: This is a straightforward temporal indicator.

"שִׁכְבַת הַטַּל" literally translates to "a layer/covering of dew." This is a precise and literal description of dew settling on the ground, forming a visible layer. No figurative language is present here.\n6.  **סָבִ֖יב לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה (sāḇîḇ lam-maḥăneh) - "about the camp"**: This is a literal spatial descriptor.

It describes a natural phenomenon, not an anthropomorphic action. `שִׁכְבַ֣ת הַטָּ֑ל` (layer of dew) is a literal description of the dew itself.\n\n2.  **`עַל־פְּנֵ֤י הַמִּדְבָּר֙` (over the surface of the wilderness):**\n    *   I considered if `פְּנֵ֤י הַמִּדְבָּר֙` (literally "face of the wilderness") might be a metaphor or personification.\n    *   My reasoning for classifying it as an idiom is based on the provided guidelines, which explicitly state that phrases like `פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה` (face of the ground/surface of the ground) are idioms and should be marked as such. The use of `פָּנִים` (face) in construct with geographical terms like `הַמִּדְבָּר` (the wilderness) is a common biblical idiom meaning "surface" or "front." It does not attribute a "face" in a literal or personified sense to the wilderness, but rather uses the term to denote its visible top layer.\n\n3.  **`דַּ֣ק מְחֻסְפָּ֔ס` (a fine and flaky substance):**\n    *   I considered if these descriptive adjectives could be part of a larger figurative expression.\n    *   My reasoning for excluding them as figurative is that `דַּ֣ק` (fine) and `מְחֻסְפָּ֔ס` (flaky) are literal, direct physical descriptions of the texture and appearance of the substance.

However, "מָן" (what) and "הוּא" (it is) combine to form a straightforward interrogative "What is it?". The immediate subsequent clause, "כִּ֛י לֹ֥א יָדְע֖וּ מַה־ה֑וּא" ("for they did not know what it was"), explicitly confirms that the Israelites were asking a literal question out of ignorance. While the name "manna" (מָן) is later derived from this question, at the moment of utterance, the phrase itself functions as a literal inquiry, not an idiom with a hidden meaning.\n    *   **Considered if it might be a metaphor:** There is no cross-domain comparison or symbolic representation intended by the speakers. They are genuinely asking for identification.\n    *   **Considered if it might be a wordplay/pun:** While the later naming of the substance as "manna" (מָן) is a clear wordplay or folk etymology based on this question, the question itself, as spoken by the Israelites, is not figurative.

However, "לְפִי" is a common preposition indicating proportion, measure, or capacity. In this context, it literally means "in proportion to what he eats" or "as much as he requires to eat." It is a direct, non-figurative statement of measurement.\n\n4.  **"עֹ֣מֶר לַגֻּלְגֹּ֗לֶת" (an omer to a head/skull)**: I considered this phrase for metonymy or synecdoche. The literal meaning of "גֻּלְגֹּלֶת" is "skull" or "head." However, in the context of distributing food ("an omer to a person"), it clearly refers to an entire individual, not just a physical head.

While "tent" literally refers to a physical dwelling, the context "each household shall fetch according to those in its tent" implies that "tent" here represents the family or household unit residing within it, rather than just the structure itself.

However, in this context, it describes a straightforward, literal physical action of collecting the manna. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **בַּבֹּ֣קֶר בַּבֹּ֔קֶר** (every morning): I considered if this repetition, which functions as an idiom for "every morning" or "morning by morning," should be classified as a figurative idiom. While it is an idiomatic construction in Hebrew to express regularity or frequency, it literally translates to "in the morning, in the morning." It directly describes a temporal frequency without employing a cross-domain comparison, personification, or other figurative device.

However, "מִשְׁנֶה" (mishneh) literally means "double" or "second" and in this context refers to a precise, quantifiable amount—twice the usual daily portion of manna.

The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

While "guarding" a physical object is literal, extending this concept to "guarding" or "preserving" the integrity and practice of laws is a common semantic extension. This usage is so pervasive and established in biblical Hebrew that it functions as a set phrase or idiom for "obeying," "observing," or "adhering to" divine instructions.

However, "quarreling" (ריב) is a direct and literal description of a verbal dispute or contention in this context. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.

It\'s not a physical experiment God undergoes, but rather a description of the people\'s attitude and actions that *challenge* God\'s authority or capability. This phrase functions as a well-established biblical idiom, conveying a theological meaning beyond a simple dictionary definition of "test." It implies a lack of trust and a challenge to divine sovereignty. It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or hyperbole.

However, the explicit mention of "for water" (לַמַּ֔יִם) grounds this in a literal physical need. This is standard narrative language describing a physical state. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n2.  **וַיָּ֥לֶן הָעָ֖ם עַל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה** (the people grumbled against Moses): I considered if "grumbled against" (וַיָּ֥לֶן הָעָ֖ם עַל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה) might be an idiom. The verb לון (lun) in the Hiphil stem (or sometimes Qal) commonly means "to complain, grumble, murmur," and the preposition עַל (al) frequently indicates the object of complaint or opposition.

The people are in a desperate situation, facing a genuine and imminent threat of death by thirst in the wilderness. While their accusation attributes a malicious *intent* to Moses ("to kill us"), which is an exaggeration of Moses\' actual purpose, the *consequence* (death by thirst) is a literal and very real possibility for them. Hyperbole typically involves an exaggeration of something not meant to be taken literally, but here, the threat of death is literal. The statement functions as a rhetorical accusation born of extreme distress and anger, rather than a figurative overstatement of a non-literal condition. Given the instruction to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Character actions and dialogue," and the literal nature of the threat, I conclude this is a literal expression of their fear and accusation, not hyperbole.

However, in biblical narrative, "crying out" (צעק) is a literal action describing a loud vocalization, often in prayer or distress. It is standard narrative language for a character\'s action and dialogue.

However, stoning was a literal form of capital punishment in the ancient Near East, and the Israelites had previously threatened Moses and Aaron (e.g., Numbers 14:10). Given the context of the people\'s rebellion and Moses\'s fear for his life, this is presented as a very real, literal, and imminent threat.

However, in the context of the Exodus narrative and divine miracles (referring to the plague where the Nile turned to blood), "struck" (הכה) describes a direct, physical action performed with the rod that initiated a supernatural physical transformation of the river. It is a literal description of Moses\' action, albeit one with miraculous consequences, not a figurative comparison or personification of the river.\n5.  **קַ֥ח בְּיָדְךָ֖** (take in your hand): I considered if "בְּיָדְךָ֖" (in your hand) could be an idiom for possession or control.

However, the instructions specify that divine anthropomorphisms (like God "standing") are to be treated as literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. Here, "standing" refers to God\'s manifestation or presence at a specific location, not a physical body part. Therefore, it is interpreted as a literal statement of God\'s presence.\n\n2.  **"עַֽל־הַצּוּר֮ בְּחֹרֵב֒" (on the rock at Horeb)**: I considered if "rock" (הַצּוּר) could be a metaphor for strength, refuge, or a divine attribute, as it often is in other biblical contexts (e.g., "God is my rock"). However, in this narrative, "the rock" is clearly a literal, specific geological feature at Horeb where the miracle is to occur. Thus, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְהִכִּ֣יתָ בַצּ֗וּר" (Strike the rock)**: This is a direct command for a physical action.

This phrase is a very common biblical idiom meaning "in the presence of," "before," or "publicly witnessed by." While the elders literally saw the event, the phrase functions as a set expression to emphasize the public and verifiable nature of the act, rather than merely the physical act of seeing. It is a metonymy where "eyes" (a part) stand for the full act of "witnessing" or "being present" (the whole experience).

The text explicitly states the reason for the naming, making it a literal account of an etiological naming event. The names "Massah" (Trial) and "Meribah" (Quarrel) are descriptive labels derived from the events, but they are not used figuratively within this sentence; rather, their literal meaning is explained. Therefore, I excluded this as figurative.\n\n2.  **רִ֣יב&thinsp;׀ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל** ("the Israelites quarreled"): I considered if "quarreled" (רִיב) could be a figurative expression. However, "quarreling" is a literal action of dispute and contention. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage beyond its direct meaning. Therefore, I excluded this as figurative.\n\n3.  **נַסֹּתָ֤ם אֶת־יְהֹוָה֙** ("they tried יהוה"): I considered if this phrase was a metaphor, personification, or idiom. It is not a metaphor, as God is not being compared to something else that is literally "tried" in a physical sense. It is not personification, as "trying" or "testing" is an action that can be directed towards a divine, anthropomorphic being in the biblical context. However, "to try/test God" (נסה את יהוה) is a well-established biblical idiom. It refers to an act of challenging God\'s faithfulness, power, or presence, often by demanding proof or complaining, rather than a literal, physical experiment. This is a specific theological concept expressed through an idiomatic phrase. Therefore, I included this as an idiom.\n\n4.  **בְּקִרְבֵּ֖נוּ** ("among us" / literally "in our midst/in our inward part"): I considered if this expression for God\'s presence was a metaphor or an idiom. While the literal meaning of קֶרֶב (qerev) can refer to an "inward part" or "midst," in the context of "Is YHWH present among us or not?", "בְּקִרְבֵּ֖נוּ" functions as a standard idiomatic expression for "with us" or "among us," signifying active presence and support within the community. It does not imply God is literally *inside* their bodies, nor is it a metaphor comparing God\'s presence to something else. It is a common and conventional way to express divine presence. Therefore, I included this as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This is a literal way of speaking about a collective entity\'s action, not a cross-domain comparison, personification of a non-human entity (Amalek refers to a human group), or an obvious simile.

It falls under "Standard narrative language" and "Character actions and dialogue," which are to be treated literally.

The term "אֲנָשִׁים" literally means "men" and is used here in its direct sense to refer to human participants. The footnote clarifies a translation nuance ("troops" for "men") but does not indicate figurative language in the Hebrew original.

"Amalek" here refers to the Amalekite people or their army, which is a common and literal way to refer to a group by its progenitor or collective name in ancient texts. This is not a figurative usage but a standard way of referring to an opposing force. No figurative language is present.\n\n4.  **"מָחָ֗ר אָנֹכִ֤י נִצָּב֙ עַל־רֹ֣אשׁ הַגִּבְעָ֔ה" (Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill):**\n    *   **Considered:** The phrase "רֹ֣אשׁ הַגִּבְעָ֔ה" (rosh ha-giv\'ah, lit. "head of the hill"). I considered if this might be personification (attributing a body part like a "head" to an inanimate hill) or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** While not a full personification implying consciousness or action, the use of "רֹאשׁ" (head) to denote the summit or highest point of an inanimate object like a hill is a conventional, non-literal extension of the word\'s primary meaning (the head of a living being). This is a common linguistic phenomenon in Hebrew, where body parts are used to describe parts of inanimate objects (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the earth"). It functions as an established idiom for the highest point or summit. The instruction explicitly states to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom." This phrase fits that description as a conventionalized expression for the top of a geographical feature.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This is a borderline case between a very common, almost fossilized, usage that some might consider purely descriptive (i.e., "the top part") and a mild form of figurative language. However, given the explicit instruction to mark "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom," and the non-literal application of "head" to a hill, it is best classified as an idiom. It is not a clear metaphor with a strong cross-domain comparison, nor is it personification implying human-like qualities beyond just having a "head."\n\n5.  **"וּמַטֵּ֥ה הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים בְּיָדִֽי" (with the rod of God in my hand):**\n    *   **Considered:** If "מַטֵּ֥ה הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים" (matteh ha-Elohim, "rod of God") is figurative, perhaps metonymy for God\'s power or presence.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This refers to a literal, physical object (the rod) that Moses holds. The descriptor "of God" indicates its divine origin, ownership, or the power associated with it, not that the rod itself is a metaphor for God or God\'s power in a figurative sense. It is a literal object with a divine attribute or association. The rod is literally in Moses\' hand. This falls under "Divine anthropomorphisms" (in terms of God\'s interaction with objects) which are to be treated literally unless they refer to God\'s body. Here, it\'s an object *associated* with God, not God\'s body part.

When applied to an inanimate geographical feature like "הַגִּבְעָה" (the hill), it constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison. A hill does not literally possess a head. This usage is metaphorical, likening the highest point of the hill to the highest part of a body. It also functions as a common idiom in Biblical Hebrew for the "summit" or "top" of a hill or mountain. The instructions specify that biblical idioms and set phrases should be classified as "idiom" type, and that clear metaphors should be marked. Furthermore, it can be understood as a form of metonymy (specifically synecdoche), where a prominent part ("head") is used to refer to the highest point or characteristic location ("top") of the whole.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: While it clearly functions as an idiom, its underlying mechanism is metaphorical and metonymic.

Instead, the action of raising the hand in this context is a well-established biblical idiom for prayer, intercession, or invoking divine power and aid. Conversely, letting down the hand signifies the cessation of this intercession or divine channeling. The meaning of these phrases extends beyond the literal sum of their parts, indicating a specific spiritual or ritualistic action with supernatural consequences. Therefore, they are classified as idioms. They also contain an element of metonymy, where the physical action (hand position) stands for the broader act of intercession or divine invocation.\n    *   **Borderline:** This was debated between a purely literal description of a physical action and an idiomatic expression. The direct and supernatural outcome tied to the physical action strongly suggests an idiomatic or symbolic meaning beyond mere physical description.\n\n2.  **"יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל" (Israel) and "עֲמָלֵֽק" (Amalek) in "וְגָבַ֣ר יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל" (Israel prevailed) and "וְגָבַ֥ר עֲמָלֵֽק" (Amalek prevailed):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if the names of the nations, "Israel" and "Amalek," are used literally to refer to the entire nation, or if they function as metonymy (specifically, synecdoche) for their respective armies or fighting forces.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In the context of battle, it is the army or military contingent of a nation that engages in combat and prevails or is defeated, not the entire civilian population. Therefore, "Israel" and "Amalek" here stand for the Israelite army and the Amalekite army, respectively. This is a common linguistic convention where the name of the whole (the nation) is used to refer to a part (its military force). This is a form of metonymy (synecdoche). While very common in narrative and often treated as standard language, it is still a substitution of terms.\n    *   **Borderline:** This is a highly conventionalized form of metonymy. However, as per the instruction to analyze *every* potential figurative element and be explicit about the reasoning, it is included due to the substitution of the whole for a part.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 4, 'instances_recovered': 4, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The hands are not literally the abstract concept itself. Instead, their physical state of being unwavering and steady is presented as the embodiment of this abstract quality.

This constitutes a clear metaphor, treating the abstract memory as if it were a physical inscription.

The act of placing a "hand upon" something in this context is not a literal physical description but a symbolic gesture signifying an oath, a pledge, or a firm resolve. The "hand" itself can be seen as metonymic, representing the power or the act of swearing. The "throne of Yah" represents divine authority.

However, the instruction states that divine anthropomorphisms are literal *unless they refer to God\'s body*. While "hand" is a body part, the phrase is "a hand upon the throne of Yah," not "God\'s hand."

However, in standard narrative, "heard" is a literal action indicating reception of information. Given the conservative instruction for narrative language, this is interpreted literally as Jethro receiving the news.\n2.  **"כֹהֵן מִדְיָן חֹתֵן מֹשֶׁה" (priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law):** I considered if these titles or familial relationships could be symbolic or metaphorical. However, these are direct, factual descriptions of Jethro\'s identity and relationship to Moses. They convey historical and genealogical information, which the instructions state should be treated conservatively and not marked as figurative.\n3.  **"אֵת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה אֱלֹהִים" (all that God had done):** I considered if "God had done" constitutes an anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. The instructions specify that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The verb "עָשָׂה" (asah, "done" or "made") is a general action and does not refer to a specific body part of God. Therefore, in line with the instructions, this is considered a literal description of divine action and not marked as figurative.\n4.  **"לְמֹשֶׁה וּלְיִשְׂרָאֵל עַמּוֹ" (for Moses and for Israel, God’s people):** I considered if "God\'s people" is a metaphorical designation. However, this is a literal and direct description of the relationship between God and the nation of Israel, indicating possession and covenantal relationship. It is standard narrative language and a statement of identity, not a cross-domain comparison.\n5.  **"כִּֽי־הוֹצִיא יְהֹוָה אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵל מִמִּצְרָֽיִם" (how יהוה had brought Israel out from Egypt):** Similar to "God had done," I considered if "הוֹצִיא" (hotzi, "brought out") is an anthropomorphism. This action describes God\'s direct intervention in the Exodus. As it is a general action and does not refer to a specific body part of God, it is treated as literal divine action according to the provided guidelines for anthropomorphisms.\n\nBased on this conservative analysis, no clear metaphors, personifications, obvious similes, or biblical idioms (as defined by the examples given) are present in this verse.

However, in standard biblical narrative, this verb frequently describes a direct, physical action of bringing or acquiring. In this context, it refers to Jethro physically bringing Zipporah. This is standard narrative language for a character\'s action and is therefore not figurative.\n*   **"חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה" / "Moses’ father-in-law"**: I considered if this familial title could be used metaphorically or as an idiom for a relationship beyond the literal genealogical connection. However, it is a direct and literal description of the familial relationship between Jethro and Moses. This is historical/genealogical information and is not figurative.\n*   **"אֶת־צִפֹּרָ֖ה אֵ֣שֶׁת מֹשֶׁ֑ה" / "Zipporah, Moses’ wife"**: I considered if "wife" (אֵשֶׁת) could be used in a non-literal sense. However, it is a direct and literal description of Zipporah\'s marital status. This is standard narrative and genealogical information and is not figurative.\n*   **"אַחַ֖ר שִׁלּוּחֶֽיהָ" / "after she had been sent home"**: I considered if "שִׁלּוּחֶֽיהָ" (shillucheha), meaning "her sending away" or "her dismissal," could be an idiom for divorce or a permanent separation, or if "home" was a figurative destination. While the root שׁלח (sh-l-h) can be associated with divorce (e.g., "bill of divorce"), in this specific narrative context (Exodus 18:2-3, referring back to Exodus 4:20-26), it describes Moses having sent Zipporah and his sons *away* from him, likely back to Jethro\'s care, before he returned to Egypt. Jethro is now bringing them *back*. The phrase "sent home" (or "sent away") describes a literal past action of physical relocation. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile. It is standard narrative language describing a historical event. This is not figurative.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, I find no elements in this verse that meet the criteria for figurative language as defined by the prompt.

I considered if "stranger" (גֵּר) or "foreign land" (אֶ֖רֶץ נׇכְרִיָּֽה) could be used metaphorically or idiomatically. However, Moses was literally a sojourner/stranger (גֵּר) in Midian, which was literally a foreign land to him, having fled Egypt. The statement describes his actual status and experience directly. It is a literal, factual explanation for the name, not a figurative description of his feelings or situation. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, hyperbole, or idiomatic usage here.

It is not figurative.\n    *   Considered if "בְּעֶזְרִ֔י" (was my help / in my help) is a metaphor.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase directly equates God (a divine being) with "help" (an abstract concept/function). While God is the *source* of help, stating that God *is* the help functions as a metaphor, where the abstract concept of "help" serves as the vehicle to describe God\'s active and supportive presence. This constitutes a cross-domain comparison (divine being to an abstract concept/function), making it a metaphor rather than merely a statement of function.\n\n3.  **וַיַּצִּלֵ֖נִי** (and delivered me):\n    *   Considered if this verb describing God\'s action is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal action performed by God.

Being delivered from the "sword of Pharaoh" means being delivered from Pharaoh\'s destructive intent or his agents (e.g., his army). This is a clear instance of metonymy, where an instrument stands for the agent or the action associated with it. This is not a fixed biblical idiom but a specific instance of metonymic usage.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This is a straightforward description of an action (bringing people). There are no cross-domain comparisons, personification, or obvious similes. It is standard narrative language describing character actions. I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **אֶל־הַמִּדְבָּ֗ר** (in the wilderness): I considered if "wilderness" could be a metaphor for a state of being or a difficult situation. However, in this context, it clearly refers to a literal geographical location where Moses was encamped. It is standard narrative language. I excluded it as figurative.\n\n3.  **אֲשֶׁר־ה֛וּא חֹנֶ֥ה שָׁ֖ם** (where he was encamped there): I considered if "encamped" could be used metaphorically for a temporary state or condition. However, it literally describes Moses\'s physical location and activity (setting up camp). It is standard narrative language. I excluded it as figurative.\n\n4.  **הַ֥ר הָאֱלֹהִֽים** (the mountain of God): This was the primary phrase considered for figurative language.\n    *   **Considered if it was a metaphor:** I considered if the mountain was being likened to God, or if God was being likened to a mountain, or if the phrase implied a cross-domain comparison. This is not the case; the mountain is not being compared to something else in a non-literal way.\n    *   **Considered if it was personification:** I considered if the mountain was being given human or divine qualities beyond its physical nature. This is not the case; the mountain itself is not acting like God or a person.\n    *   **Considered if it was an idiom:** I considered if "mountain of God" had a meaning that could not be understood from the literal meaning of its constituent words. However, "mountain of God" literally means "the mountain of God," signifying a mountain belonging to, designated by, or associated with God. Its meaning is direct and transparent in the context of sacred geography. Therefore, it is not an idiom.\n    *   **Considered if it was metonymy:** I debated whether "God" in "mountain of God" could be a metonymy for "God\'s presence," "God\'s sacredness," or "God\'s power," implying that the mountain is sacred *because* of God. While this interpretation has some theological nuance, in the context of biblical narrative and ANE understanding, "mountain of God" (הר האלהים) functions primarily as a literal descriptive title for a specific sacred mountain (Mount Sinai/Horeb). It designates a geographical location that has a special, divinely-appointed status or association. The instructions emphasize being "conservative" with standard narrative language and only marking "clear metaphors," "personification," or "obvious similes." While metonymy is a type to mark, this particular instance is not "clear" in the sense of a substitution that significantly alters the literal meaning of the phrase for the average reader. It is a direct, albeit significant, attribution. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative metonymy, opting for a literal interpretation as a descriptive title for a sacred place.\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, no figurative language is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, this is standard narrative language reporting a direct act of communication, whether spoken directly or conveyed via messenger. It is a literal action of speaking or transmitting a message, not a figurative representation.\n\n2.  **אֲנִ֛י חֹתֶנְךָ֥ יִתְר֖וֹ** (I, your father-in-law Jethro): I considered if the term "father-in-law" could be used in a metaphorical sense, perhaps implying a mentor or a figure of authority beyond the literal familial tie. However, "father-in-law" (חֹתֶן) is a precise and literal genealogical descriptor of Jethro\'s relationship to Moses. There is no indication that it is being used figuratively to denote a role or function other than the direct family relationship.\n\n3.  **בָּ֣א אֵלֶ֑יךָ** (am coming to you): I considered if "coming" could be a metaphor for an abstract arrival, influence, or a spiritual presence.

This is a straightforward description of a physical action.\n\n4.  **וְאִ֨שְׁתְּךָ֔ וּשְׁנֵ֥י בָנֶ֖יהָ עִמָּֽהּ** (with your wife and her two sons): I considered if "wife" or "sons" could be used figuratively, perhaps representing a legacy, a group of followers, or a symbolic aspect of Moses\' life.

"לְשָׁל֑וֹם" in this context refers to an inquiry about the well-being or "shalom" of the other person.

"Asking for shalom" is a direct, literal inquiry about someone\'s state of peace or welfare, not a figurative expression.

Following the instructions, divine anthropomorphisms are considered literal unless they refer to God\'s body. "Done" is a general action and does not refer to a specific body part, so it is interpreted literally.\n3.  **עַ֖ל אוֹדֹ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל** (for Israel’s sake): I considered this as a literal statement of purpose or reason. It is a standard prepositional phrase and not figurative.\n4.  **אֵ֤ת כׇּל־הַתְּלָאָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר מְצָאָ֣תַם בַּדֶּ֔רֶךְ** (all the hardships that had befallen them on the way): I specifically examined the phrase "הַתְּלָאָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר מְצָאָ֣תַם" (hardships that found them / had befallen them).\n    *   I considered if this was a form of personification, as "hardships" (an abstract concept) are described as "finding" (מָצָא) the people. The verb "to find" typically implies an agent with the capacity for perception and movement.\n    *   My reasoning for including it as personification is that attributing the action of "finding" to an abstract, inanimate entity like "hardships" endows it with a human-like quality or agency. Hardships do not literally seek out and find people; rather, people encounter or experience them. This is a clear instance of personification where an abstract concept is endowed with an animate action.\n    *   I debated whether this might be considered a common idiom that has lost its figurative force. However, the instruction to "MARK Personification of non-human entities" is quite direct. Hardships are non-human, and "finding" is an action typically associated with animate beings. Therefore, it fits the definition of personification.\n5.  **וַיַּצִּלֵ֖ם יְהֹוָֽה** (and יהוה had delivered them): I considered "YHWH had delivered them" as a divine anthropomorphism.

However, it is a straightforward description of Jethro\'s emotional state, a common human action, and falls under standard narrative language for character actions. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **עַ֚ל כׇּל־הַטּוֹבָ֔ה (over all the kindness):** I considered if "kindness" could be a euphemism or a general term for specific acts, making it figurative. However, "kindness" (טוֹבָה) is a literal quality or beneficial act. It is standard narrative language describing the nature of God\'s actions. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה לְיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל (that יהוה had shown Israel / that YHWH did for Israel):** I considered if attributing "doing/showing kindness" to YHWH constitutes divine anthropomorphism that should be marked as figurative. The instructions explicitly state: "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Doing/showing kindness" is an action, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, according to the guidelines, it is considered literal and not figurative.\n*   **אֲשֶׁ֥ר הִצִּיל֖וֹ (when delivering them):** I considered if "delivering" could be a metaphor for a more complex process. However, "delivering" (הִצִּיל) is a literal action of rescue or salvation. It is standard narrative language describing a divine action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n*   **מִיַּ֥ד מִצְרָֽיִם (from the hand of Egypt):** I considered this phrase as a potential instance of metonymy and/or idiom. The Hebrew "מִיַּד" literally means "from the hand of". In this context, "the hand of Egypt" does not refer to a literal physical hand but rather to the power, control, or authority of the Egyptian nation. This is a classic example of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part stands for the whole or an attribute of the whole). Furthermore, "מִיַּד" is a very common biblical idiom used to express "from the power/control of" or "from the grasp of". The instructions explicitly state that "synecdoche is a type of metonymy" and that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase fits both descriptions. Therefore, it is figurative, specifically metonymy and an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In biblical Hebrew, "יַד" is frequently used metonymically to signify power, authority, or agency. The context of being "delivered from" clearly indicates liberation from the *power* or *dominion* of the Egyptians, not their literal hands. This is a well-established biblical idiom. Reasoning: This is a clear instance of metonymy and an idiom, where "hand" stands for the power or authority of the entity.\n*   **"וּמִיַּ֣ד פַּרְעֹ֑ה" (and from the hand of Pharaoh):** Similar to the previous phrase, "יַד" (hand) here refers to the power or authority of Pharaoh, not his literal hand.

This phrase explicitly combines "under" with "hand," further emphasizing the state of subjugation or control. To be "under the hand of" someone is an idiom for being under their authority or oppression. Therefore, being delivered "from under the hand of" signifies liberation from that oppressive power.

It reflects Jethro\'s intellectual and spiritual realization. No figurative meaning is present.\n\n2.  **"כִּֽי־גָד֥וֹל יְהֹוָ֖ה מִכׇּל־הָאֱלֹהִ֑ים" (that יהוה is greater than all gods):**\n    *   **Considered:** If this comparison of greatness constitutes a simile or hyperbole.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function, such as \'a prophet like myself\' (כָּמֹנִי) or \'a prophet like yourself\' (כָּמוֹךָ). These are literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function, not figurative similes. Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This statement is a direct, literal comparison of YHWH\'s power, status, and divine nature relative to other deities. It is a statement of theological truth and superiority, not a figurative comparison.\n\n3.  **"כִּ֣י בַדָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר זָד֖וּ עֲלֵיהֶֽם" (yes, by the result of their very schemes against [the people]):**\n    *   **Considered:**\n        *   If "בַדָּבָר" (in/by the matter/thing) could be a metonymy for "by the result/consequence."\n        *   If the entire phrase constitutes an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Metonymy for "דָּבָר":** While "דָּבָר" (matter, thing, word, event) can sometimes imply consequences in certain contexts, in this verse, it most naturally refers to the specific historical event or "matter" (i.e., the Exodus, the drowning of the Egyptians) in which YHWH demonstrated His greatness. Jethro is pointing to the event itself as the evidence. Saying "YHWH is greater *in the matter* where they acted presumptuously" is a literal way of stating the context or reason for YHWH\'s demonstrated superiority. It\'s not a substitution of a related concept (the matter) for another (the result), but rather a direct reference to the event that serves as proof. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a clear or obvious metonymy.\n        *   **Idiom:** The phrase "בַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר זָדוּ עֲלֵיהֶם" (in the matter which they acted presumptuously against them) is a descriptive clause. Its meaning can be directly deduced from the literal meaning of its constituent words. It does not function as a set phrase with a non-literal, conventional meaning distinct from its parts, unlike the examples provided in the guidelines (e.g., "mouth of the sword").\n\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** The English translation\'s note "Meaning of Heb. uncertain" and its rendering "by the result of their very schemes" might suggest a non-literal interpretation. However, adhering to the conservative approach and the specific definitions provided, the Hebrew phrase can be understood literally as referring to the specific event/circumstance that demonstrated YHWH\'s greatness. The verb זָד (zad) itself means to act presumptuously or arrogantly, which is a literal description of the Egyptians\' actions.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a conservative analysis and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language is present in this verse.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Thus, "to eat bread" becomes an idiomatic expression for "to partake of a meal" or "to have fellowship over food." This is a very common and conventional usage in the Hebrew Bible. The instructions specify that biblical idioms and set phrases should be classified as "idiom."\n    *   **Decision:** Marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n4.  **"לִפְנֵ֥י הָאֱלֹהִֽים" (lifnei ha\'elohim) - "before God" (literally "to the face of God")**\n    *   **Considered:** If "before God" is a literal spatial description, a divine anthropomorphism, or an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase "לִפְנֵי" (lifnei) is derived from פָּנִים (panim, "face") and literally means "to the face of." However, as a preposition, it is a highly conventionalized idiom in Hebrew meaning "in the presence of," "before," or "in front of." It does not primarily describe God\'s physical face in a literal anthropomorphic sense, but rather uses the concept of "face" metonymically to denote presence or location relative to God. The instructions explicitly list "פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה" ("face of the ground") as an idiom, which uses "face" in a similar conventionalized manner. Therefore, "לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים" functions as an idiom for "in the presence of God," employing metonymy that has become idiomatic.\n    *   **Decision:** Marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, it is a straightforward, literal statement indicating the chronological sequence of events. It is standard narrative language.\n\n2.  **וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב מֹשֶׁ֖ה** (Moses sat): I considered if "sat" could be a metonymy for "presided" or "judged," as sitting is a common posture for judges. However, the text immediately clarifies his purpose with "לִשְׁפֹּ֣ט אֶת־הָעָ֑ם" (to judge the people). Therefore, "sat" describes a literal physical action taken to perform his duty, rather than being a figurative representation of the duty itself. It is literal.\n\n3.  **לִשְׁפֹּ֣ט אֶת־הָעָ֑ם** (to judge the people): This phrase describes Moses\'s explicit function and action. It is a literal statement of his role and activity.\n\n4.  **וַיַּעֲמֹ֤ד הָעָם֙ עַל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה** (while the people stood about Moses): I considered if the preposition עַל (on/about/by) could imply a figurative sense, such as standing *against* Moses or standing *on* him in a burdensome way. However, in this context, "stood about Moses" is the most natural and literal interpretation, describing their physical presence and positioning around him as they awaited his judgment. It is a literal description of their action and location.\n\n5.  **מִן־הַבֹּ֖קֶר עַד־הָעָֽרֶב** (from morning until evening): This was the most debated phrase. I considered if it could be hyperbole, an idiom, or a temporal metaphor.\n    *   **Hyperbole**: While "from morning until evening" can emphasize a long duration, the narrative context (Exodus 18:14-18) explicitly presents this duration as a literal problem for Moses, leading to Jethro\'s advice. The text intends for the reader to understand that Moses *actually* spent the entire day judging, which is why he was wearing himself out. If it were hyperbole, it would undermine the literal problem being presented. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration beyond what is literally possible or intended by the narrative.\n    *   **Idiom**: This phrase is a common temporal expression in Hebrew, but it literally means "from morning until evening." It does not carry a specialized, non-literal meaning distinct from the sum of its parts, unlike other biblical idioms (e.g., "face of the earth").\n    *   **Metaphor**: There is no cross-domain comparison or symbolic representation intended. It is a direct statement of time.\n    This phrase is standard narrative language used to describe the full duration of a day\'s activity. It is literal.\n\nBased on this conservative analysis, no figurative language is present in this verse.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the accompanying English translation note ("act Lit. \'sit\' as magistrate") and common biblical usage indicate that "to sit" in this context is an idiom for exercising authority, presiding, or acting as a judge or magistrate. This is a well-established biblical idiom where a physical posture represents a specific role or function. Therefore, I am classifying this as an idiom.\n\n4.  **"וְכׇל־הָעָ֛ם נִצָּ֥ב עָלֶ֖יךָ" (while all the people stand about you)**: I considered if "stand about you" (נִצָּב עָלֶיךָ) was figurative.

Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and not to mark proportional or behavioral comparisons, I interpret this as a literal description of the duration of the people\'s waiting and Moses\' work, rather than an exaggeration. It conveys the general truth of the situation without being a clear metaphor, personification, or obvious simile.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Instead, it denotes a specialized religious practice of seeking divine judgment, guidance, or revelation, often through an intermediary like Moses, or through specific rituals. This phrase functions as a well-established biblical idiom or set phrase for a specific religious action that goes beyond the literal meaning of "inquire." The guidelines explicitly state that "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase fits that description, as it conveys a specialized, non-literal meaning of "inquiring" in a religious context. It is not a metaphor because God is not being likened to something else, nor is it personification of God (as God is already understood as a personal entity in the ANE context). The figurative aspect lies in the specialized, non-literal meaning of the *action* of "inquiring."', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It carries the connotation of heeding, obeying, or accepting the words, counsel, or authority of the speaker. Therefore, "voice" (קול) functions metonymically, representing the message, instruction, or authority conveyed through speech.

This is a very common conceptual metaphor in biblical Hebrew, where life\'s journey is conceptualized as a path, and one\'s conduct as walking on that path. Therefore, it is a metaphor. I debated whether to classify this as an idiom due to its commonality in biblical discourse. However, the connection between a physical path and a course of conduct is quite transparent, making it primarily a conceptual metaphor rather than an opaque, fixed idiom like the examples provided in the instructions (e.g., "mouth of the sword").\n4.  **וְאֶת־הַֽמַּעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יַעֲשֽׂוּן** ("and the practices they are to follow"):\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "practices" (מַעֲשֶׂה) or "to follow/do" (יַעֲשׂוּן) might be used figuratively.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are literal terms referring to actions, deeds, or behaviors.

I concluded that this is a literal instruction for Moses to identify and select individuals from the general populace. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.\n\n2.  **אַנְשֵׁי־חַ֜יִל** (capable individuals / men of valor): I considered if "men of valor" (a more literal translation of `anshei chayil`) might be a metaphor or idiom. However, `ish chayil` is a standard descriptive phrase in Hebrew to denote individuals possessing strength, ability, competence, or wealth. It directly describes an inherent quality or characteristic of the individuals, rather than likening them to something else. Therefore, I concluded it is a literal description of their quality, not figurative.\n\n3.  **יִרְאֵ֧י אֱלֹהִ֛ים** (who fear God): I considered if "fear God" should be interpreted literally as terror or figuratively. This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom. It signifies a deep reverence, respect, obedience, and piety towards God, rather than a simple emotion of terror. The instructions explicitly state that biblical idioms and set phrases should be classified as "idiom" type if they are figurative. Given its conventional meaning in biblical literature, this is a figurative idiom.\n\n4.  **אַנְשֵׁ֥י אֱמֶ֖ת** (trustworthy ones / men of truth): Similar to `anshei chayil`, I considered if "men of truth" might be figurative. This phrase directly describes individuals characterized by truthfulness, integrity, and reliability. It is a literal description of their moral quality, not a metaphor, simile, or idiom.\n\n5.  **שֹׂ֣נְאֵי בָ֑צַע** (who spurn ill-gotten gain / haters of unjust gain): I considered if "haters of unjust gain" could be figurative. This is a direct and literal description of their moral stance and attitude towards corruption or illicit profit. It expresses a clear characteristic of the individuals being sought. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n6.  **וְשַׂמְתָּ֣ עֲלֵהֶ֗ם שָׂרֵ֤י אֲלָפִים֙ שָׂרֵ֣י מֵא֔וֹת שָׂרֵ֥י חֲמִשִּׁ֖ים וְשָׂרֵ֥י עֲשָׂרֹֽת** (Set these over them as chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens): I considered if the titles "chiefs of thousands," "chiefs of hundreds," etc., could be figurative. These are literal administrative titles describing a hierarchical structure of leadership over specific numerical groups. They are not metaphors, similes, or idioms, but rather direct descriptions of roles and organizational structure.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only `יִרְאֵ֧י אֱלֹהִ֛ים` ("who fear God") is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in this context, it refers directly to the specific act of adjudicating disputes, which is a literal function of judges. There is no non-literal substitution of a related concept. Thus, it is not figurative.\n2.  **כׇּל־הַדָּבָ֤ר הַגָּדֹל֙ יָבִ֣יאוּ אֵלֶ֔יךָ וְכׇל־הַדָּבָ֥ר הַקָּטֹ֖ן יִשְׁפְּטוּ־הֵ֑ם** (Have them bring every major dispute to you, but let them decide every minor dispute themselves): I considered if "major dispute" or "minor dispute" could be figurative, perhaps hyperbole or synecdoche. However, "דָּבָר" (davar) literally means "word," "thing," or "matter," and when qualified by "גָּדֹל" (gadol, great/major) or "קָּטֹן" (qaton, small/minor), it literally refers to the scale or importance of the legal matter. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning here. Thus, it is not figurative.\n3.  **וְהָקֵל֙ מֵֽעָלֶ֔יךָ** (Make it easier for yourself / lighten [the burden] from upon you): I considered if "lighten from upon you" (literally "make light from upon you") could be a metaphor for reducing responsibility. While it strongly implies a reduction of burden, the verb קלל (qalal) "to be light, swift, trifling" is used here in the Hiphil "to make light, lighten." This is a direct description of the *effect* of reducing responsibility, which is to make the task "lighter." It sets up the following metaphor but is not itself a metaphor for the responsibility itself. It describes the *state* of the responsibility becoming lighter, which is a literal consequence of sharing it. It\'s a very common way to express making something easier. I debated if this was a borderline case of idiom or metaphor, but ultimately, it describes the *quality* of the task (its weight/difficulty) becoming less, which is a literal consequence of the proposed action. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n4.  **וְנָשְׂא֖וּ אִתָּֽךְ** (and they shall carry with you / share the burden with you): I considered if "carry with you" (נָשְׂא֖וּ אִתָּֽךְ) was a literal physical act. In the context of judging disputes and the preceding phrase "make it easier for yourself" (literally "lighten from upon you"), it is clear that the "carrying" refers to the responsibility and workload of judging, not a physical object. The abstract concept of judicial responsibility is being likened to a physical burden or weight that can be carried. Sharing this "carrying" means sharing the responsibility and its associated difficulties. This is a clear metaphor. The implied "burden" is the weight of the judicial task. This phrase is marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It is not referring to a physical posture but to resilience, steadfastness, and capacity. This is a common idiomatic extension of the verb\'s meaning in Hebrew, where a physical action represents an abstract state or ability. This is a clear example of an idiom.\n\n4.  **וְגַם֙ כׇּל־הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה** (and all these people too)\n    *   Considered if "all these people" could be figurative (e.g., hyperbole).\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal reference to the entire group of people.

While "peace" (שָׁלוֹם) can encompass various aspects of well-being beyond just the absence of conflict, its use here describes a literal state of being (safe, well, unwearied in the context of the English translation), not a figurative comparison or a non-literal meaning.

My reasoning for excluding it as figurative is that it is a standard descriptive phrase in Hebrew for competent, virtuous, or wealthy men. While it describes a quality, it does so directly rather than through a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal expression. It functions as a compound noun phrase describing the type of men, not as a figurative idiom.\n\n2.  **מִכׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל** (out of all Israel): This is a literal statement referring to the entire nation of Israel.

While the term "head" originates from the physical body part, its application to leadership (being "at the top" or "in charge") is a very common and conventionalized expression in Hebrew (and many other languages). It functions as a lexicalized metaphor, meaning it\'s so ingrained in the language that it\'s often not perceived as a fresh, vivid comparison but rather as a direct term for leadership. However, the instructions explicitly state to "classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Since "head" for "leader" is a conventional metaphor that acts as a fixed expression for a social role, it fits the criteria of a figurative idiom. It involves a cross-domain comparison (physical body part to social hierarchy/authority). Therefore, I am marking this as an idiom that is also a conventional metaphor.\n\n4.  **שָׂרֵ֤י אֲלָפִים֙ שָׂרֵ֣י מֵא֔וֹת שָׂרֵ֥י חֲמִשִּׁ֖ים וְשָׂרֵ֥י עֲשָׂרֹֽת** (chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens): I considered if "שָׂרֵי" (sarei, "chiefs") or the numerical divisions were figurative.

While the English "bade farewell" carries a nuance of polite parting, the underlying Hebrew is a direct description of an action. It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or a biblical idiom requiring a non-literal interpretation.

However, the analysis must focus on the Hebrew. The Hebrew "וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ ל֖וֹ" literally means "and he went for himself" or "he went on his own." The dative pronoun לֹו (lo) emphasizes the subject\'s independent action or destination, which is a common and literal grammatical construction in biblical Hebrew. It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or a fixed biblical idiom with a non-literal meaning.

However, in the ancient Near East, the new moon (ראש חודש, *rosh chodesh*) literally marked the beginning of a month and was often used to refer to the month itself. This is a direct, literal temporal designation, not a figurative substitution. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **לְצֵ֥את בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל (after the Israelites had gone forth):** I considered if "gone forth" could be a euphemism or an idiom. However, "to go forth" (יצא, *yatza*) is a literal verb of movement. "Israelites" (בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵל) is a literal designation for the people. This is a straightforward description of a physical action. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n3.  **מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם (from the land of Egypt):** This phrase refers to a specific, literal geographical location. There is no metaphorical, metonymic, or other figurative meaning intended. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **בַּיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה (on that very day):** This is a literal temporal marker, specifying a particular day. There is no figurative meaning. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **בָּ֖אוּ (they entered):** Similar to "gone forth," "to enter" (בוא, *bo*) is a literal verb of movement. This describes a direct physical action.

The act of "going up" is a literal physical movement towards a specific location where God\'s presence is manifested. This is not a metaphor for a purely spiritual or abstract ascent, but a concrete action in the physical world. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֵלָ֤יו יְהֹוָה֙ מִן־הָהָ֣ר לֵאמֹ֔ר** (יהוה called to him from the mountain, saying)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "יהוה called" might be figurative (e.g., personification if God were non-human, or a metaphor for divine communication). I also considered if "from the mountain" was figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The instruction explicitly states that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "יהוה called" falls under this category of divine action, which is to be understood literally within the ANE worldview presented in the text. "From the mountain" is a literal spatial descriptor of where the call originated. Therefore, neither is figurative.\n\n3.  **כֹּ֤ה תֹאמַר֙ לְבֵ֣ית יַעֲקֹ֔ב** (Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "לְבֵ֣ית יַעֲקֹ֔ב" (the house of Jacob) is figurative, specifically as a metonymy or idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "House of Jacob" is a well-established biblical idiom and a form of metonymy (specifically synecdoche) where "house" (בַּיִת), which literally refers to a dwelling or household, stands for the entire family, lineage, or nation descended from Jacob. The instructions state, "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase perfectly fits this criterion. It is a cross-domain comparison where a physical structure/household represents a social group/lineage. Therefore, it is figurative.\n\n4.  **וְתַגֵּ֖יד לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל** (and declare to the children of Israel)\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל" (the children of Israel) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Children of Israel" is a direct genealogical and historical term referring to the descendants of Israel (Jacob). While it refers to the collective nation, it does so through a literal description of their lineage. The instructions state, "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Historical and genealogical information." This phrase falls under genealogical information. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n**Borderline cases debated:**\nThe primary point of deliberation was distinguishing between "house of Jacob" and "children of Israel." While both refer to the nation, "house of Jacob" employs the term "house" (בַּיִת) in a non-literal sense to represent the people, making it an idiom and metonymy. "Children of Israel," however, is a direct, literal genealogical descriptor of the people as descendants, aligning with the instruction to not mark genealogical information as figurative.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This is a clear cross-domain comparison where God\'s act of delivering Israel is likened to an eagle carrying its young on its wings. It vividly describes the manner of their deliverance as swift, powerful, protective, and secure. This is a strong metaphor. While one might argue it functions idiomatically for swift deliverance, the specific and evocative imagery of "eagles\' wings" makes it a clear metaphor rather than a generic idiom. It does not refer to God\'s body in a literal anthropomorphic sense, but rather uses an image to describe the *manner* of His action.\n\n4.  **"וָאָבִ֥א אֶתְכֶ֖ם אֵלָֽי" / "and brought you to Me"**: I considered if "brought you to Me" might be figurative, referring to a spiritual or covenantal bringing.

Thus, it primarily refers to a literal, geographical bringing, which then facilitates the relational aspect.

Here, the "voice" (vehicle) stands for the speaker\'s commands, authority, or will (target).

The nation of Israel is being described as a "kingdom of priests."\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a clear metaphor. Israel is a nation, not literally a political "kingdom" composed *solely* of officiating "priests" in the traditional sense. The phrase uses the concept of a "kingdom" (a political entity with a ruler and structure) and "priests" (religious functionaries who mediate) to describe the *identity* and *role* of the entire nation. It\'s a cross-domain comparison where a social group (Israel) is likened to a unique, idealized entity ("kingdom of priests") to convey its sacred status, mediating function between God and the world, and its unique national purpose. It goes beyond a simple functional comparison (like "a prophet like myself") by redefining their collective being.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: One might argue it\'s a literal description of their *function* or *status*. However, the combination of "kingdom" and "priests" to describe an entire nation creates a new conceptual entity that is not literally true in a political or sociological sense.

I considered if "came" could be figurative, but in this narrative context, it is a straightforward description of action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיִּקְרָ֖א לְזִקְנֵ֣י הָעָ֑ם (and summoned the elders of the people)**: This describes a literal act of calling or summoning. "Elders of the people" (זִקְנֵ֣י הָעָ֑ם) refers to a specific group of leaders or representatives within the community, not a figurative use of "elders" (e.g., not personifying the people as having literal old age). Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **וַיָּ֣שֶׂם לִפְנֵיהֶ֗ם (and put before them)**: This phrase was carefully considered.\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if this phrase might be a metaphor, metonymy, or idiom. The literal meaning of "וַיָּ֣שֶׂם" (he placed/put) combined with "לִפְנֵיהֶ֗ם" (before their faces) would imply a physical placement of objects. However, the objects being "put before them" are "all these words/things" (כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה), which refer to God\'s commands. One does not literally place abstract commands in front of someone\'s face.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: This is a common idiomatic expression in Biblical Hebrew, "שׂים לפני" (to place before), meaning to present, declare, or set forth information, laws, or proposals for consideration. It is not a literal physical act. As per instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."\n    *   Furthermore, it functions as a metonymy. The physical action of "placing something in front of someone" (the vehicle) is used to represent the abstract communicative action of "presenting or declaring information" (the target). The two concepts are closely associated, as physical presentation often accompanies verbal declaration.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: While it could be argued as a very common, almost fossilized expression, its non-literal meaning when applied to abstract "words" or "commands" firmly places it in the realm of figurative language, specifically as an idiom and a metonymy.\n\n4.  **אֵ֚ת כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה (all these words/things)**: This refers literally to the commands or instructions given by God. "Words" (דְּבָרִים) can denote matters, affairs, or commands, which is a standard semantic range for the term, not a figurative usage here. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּ֖הוּ יְהֹוָֽה (that יהוה had commanded him)**: This is a literal statement about God\'s action. "יהוה commanded" is an anthropomorphism (God acting like a human), but the instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Commanded" is an action and does not refer to God\'s body. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only "וַיָּ֣שֶׂם לִפְנֵיהֶ֗ם" is identified as figurative language.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While the English translation "as one" might suggest a simile, the Hebrew is a direct, literal description of the collective and unanimous nature of their response. It indicates that they spoke in unison or with a single sentiment, which is a literal action for a group.

"Spoken" describes an action of God\'s communication and does not refer to a physical body part in a figurative manner.

Instead, he is conveying the *content*, *message*, or *declaration* that the people made. The term "words" (דִּבְרֵ֥י) is used here to represent the message itself.

It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or idiom.\n\n2.  **"הִנֵּ֨ה אָנֹכִ֜י בָּ֣א אֵלֶ֘יךָ֮" (I will come to you):** I considered if God "coming" should be marked as a figurative anthropomorphism. The guidelines explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." God "coming" is an action, not a reference to a specific body part. Therefore, within the ANE worldview, this is understood as a literal, albeit supernatural, manifestation or movement of God\'s presence, not a figurative expression.\n\n3.  **"בְּעַ֣ב הֶֽעָנָן֒" (in a thick cloud):** I considered if the "thick cloud" is a metaphor, metonymy, or symbol for God\'s presence, mystery, or power. In the biblical narrative and ANE context, divine manifestations frequently occur within natural phenomena like clouds (e.g., the pillar of cloud, the cloud on Sinai). This is consistently presented as the literal medium through which God appears or communicates, rather than a figurative representation *of* God or an abstract concept. The cloud is the actual, physical (or theo-physical) vehicle of God\'s appearance, not a symbolic stand-in. It is not a metaphor (God is not being likened to a cloud), nor a simile (God is not like a cloud), nor metonymy (the cloud is not standing for an abstract concept in a figurative way, but is the actual means of appearance).\n\n4.  **"בַּעֲב֞וּר יִשְׁמַ֤ע הָעָם֙ בְּדַבְּרִ֣י עִמָּ֔ךְ" (in order that the people may hear when I speak with you):** This phrase describes a literal act of the people hearing God\'s voice as God speaks with Moses.

The act of trusting is also literal.\n\n6.  **"וַיַּגֵּ֥ד מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הָעָ֖ם אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה" (Then Moses reported the people’s words to יהוה):** This is a straightforward narrative description of Moses conveying information to God.

However, in the context of Mount Sinai, this refers to the literal, physical act of establishing a boundary (e.g., with ropes or markers) around the base of the mountain to prevent people from approaching. This is a direct command for a physical action, not a figurative expression.\n\n2.  **"הִשָּׁמְר֥וּ לָכֶ֛ם עֲל֥וֹת בָּהָ֖ר" (Beware of going up the mountain):** I considered if "going up the mountain" could be a metaphor for spiritual ascent or a forbidden act in a broader sense.

This is a literal prohibition against physically ascending the mountain.\n\n3.  **"וּנְגֹ֣עַ בְּקָצֵ֑הוּ" (or touching the border of it):** I considered if "touching the border" might be a metonymy for transgressing a general limit.

The consequence, "shall be put to death," is a literal legal decree, not a figurative expression of severe punishment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the language in this verse is entirely literal, describing concrete actions, prohibitions, and consequences related to the physical presence of Mount Sinai and the people\'s interaction with it.

The English translation "warned the people to stay pure" is an interpretation of the *purpose* of the sanctification.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In the biblical context, "sanctifying the people" refers to a specific set of ritual actions and instructions (e.g., setting boundaries, abstaining from certain activities, washing clothes) that prepare the people for a sacred encounter. While the *outcome* or *purpose* is spiritual purity, the act of "sanctifying" itself is a literal ritual performance by Moses. It is not a metaphor (e.g., "Moses purified their hearts" would be metaphorical), nor is it an idiom in the sense of a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning. It is a direct description of a ritual action.\n\n3.  **וַֽיְכַבְּס֖וּ שִׂמְלֹתָֽם (and they washed their clothes):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "washed their clothes" is figurative, particularly as a symbolic act of purification.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The physical act of washing clothes is literal. In the context of Exodus 19, this action is commanded as part of the preparation for meeting God, signifying ritual purity. While the act carries profound symbolic meaning, the *description* of the action itself is literal. It is not a metaphor (the clothes are not *being* purity), a simile (clothes are not *like* purity), or personification. It is also not an idiom in the sense of a fixed phrase whose meaning is entirely non-literal (like "face of the earth"). The people literally performed the action of washing their garments. The guidelines instruct to be conservative with "Standard narrative language" and "Character actions," which this phrase clearly falls under. Therefore, despite its symbolic significance within the ritual, the language describing the action is literal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, or non-literal idiom are present in this verse. All actions and descriptions are literal within their narrative and ritual context.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, "to dawn" is a standard, literal verb used to describe the beginning of the day.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"thunder, and lightning" (קֹלֹ֨ת וּבְרָקִ֜ים)**: I considered if these natural phenomena might be symbolic or metaphorical. However, they are presented as direct, literal occurrences as part of the theophany on Mount Sinai. There is no indication of a cross-domain comparison or a non-literal meaning. They are simply descriptions of the physical environment. Therefore, they are not figurative.\n\n3.  **"a dense cloud" (וְעָנָ֤ן כָּבֵד֙)**: I considered if the adjective "dense" (כָּבֵד, literally "heavy") could be used metaphorically. However, "dense" or "heavy" is a literal descriptor of the physical characteristic of a cloud, indicating its thickness and opacity. It is a direct observation of the cloud\'s physical state.

While the sound is described as extremely intense, the context is a divine manifestation, where extraordinary phenomena are expected. Describing the sound as "very loud" is a literal intensification of its volume, not an exaggeration beyond what is plausible or intended to be understood non-literally in this context. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"all the people... trembled" (וַיֶּחֱרַ֥ד כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם)**: I considered several possibilities for this phrase:\n    *   **Metaphor**: There is no comparison of the people to another entity that trembles.

The text describes the action itself, not using it as a figurative stand-in for the emotion. It is a literal physical reaction.\n    *   **Hyperbole**: I considered if "trembled" exaggerates the physical reaction of the people. Given the overwhelming and terrifying nature of the divine presence and the accompanying phenomena (thunder, lightning, dense cloud, loud horn blast), trembling is a plausible and expected physical response. It is not an impossible or absurd exaggeration. The statement "all the people" refers to the scope of the reaction, not an exaggeration of the *degree* of trembling beyond physical possibility.\n\nBased on the conservative guidelines, which prioritize literal interpretations of standard narrative language and character actions, I find no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, hyperbole, or metonymy in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

While the English translation "foot of the mountain" clearly employs personification (a mountain having a "foot"), the Hebrew `תַּחְתִּית` itself does not carry the same strong personifying force as `רֶגֶל` (foot/leg) would. However, applying the concept of a "bottom" or "lowest part" (which often refers to the base of an animate object or a container) to a geographical feature like a mountain constitutes a cross-domain comparison. This is a subtle, almost fossilized, metaphor. Furthermore, `תַּחְתִּית הָהָר` is a standard and fixed expression in Hebrew to refer to the base of a mountain, functioning as a set phrase or idiom. Given the instructions to mark "clear metaphors with cross-domain comparisons" and to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom," I have decided to classify this as both a metaphor and an idiom.

The verb עָשַׁן (ashan) means "to smoke" or "to be smoky." While mountains do not literally produce smoke from within themselves like a fire, describing a mountain as "smoking" when it is covered in or emitting smoke (due to a fire on it, or a volcanic eruption) is a direct, descriptive use of language for its appearance. It is not attributing a human-like action or emotion to the mountain, but rather describing its physical state. Therefore, I concluded it is a literal description of the mountain\'s appearance, not figurative.\n*   **"מִ֠פְּנֵ֠י אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָרַ֥ד עָלָ֛יו יְהֹוָ֖ה בָּאֵ֑שׁ" / "for יהוה had come down upon it in fire"**: I considered this as a potential divine anthropomorphism. According to the guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms (like "God came down") are to be treated as literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body parts. This phrase describes God\'s action and presence, not a specific body part. Therefore, I concluded it is a literal statement according to the provided rules.\n*   **"וַיַּ֤עַל עֲשָׁנוֹ֙ כְּעֶ֣שֶׁן הַכִּבְשָׁ֔ן" / "the smoke rose like the smoke of a kiln"**: I considered this as a simile. The presence of the comparative particle כְּ ("like") explicitly draws a comparison between the smoke rising from Mount Sinai and the smoke rising from a kiln. This is a clear and obvious simile, directly comparing two distinct entities based on a shared quality (the appearance, density, or volume of the smoke). I have marked this as figurative.\n*   **"וַיֶּחֱרַ֥ד כׇּל־הָהָ֖ר מְאֹֽד" / "and the whole mountain trembled violently"**: I considered this as personification. The verb חרד (ḥārad) means "to tremble, quake, be terrified, be anxious." While a mountain can physically shake (e.g., due to an earthquake), attributing "trembling violently" (מְאֹֽד) to an inanimate mountain, especially in the context of a divine manifestation, goes beyond a mere physical description. It imbues the mountain with a reaction akin to a living being experiencing fear, awe, or intense agitation. This attributes a human-like emotional or sentient response to an inanimate object. I have marked this as figurative.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"Grew louder and louder" (הוֹלֵךְ וְחָזֵק מְאֹד) describes a literal increase in the sound\'s intensity. While "הוֹלֵךְ וְחָזֵק" is an idiomatic construction in Hebrew for continuous increase, it describes a literal physical phenomenon (sound getting stronger).

The focus is on "בְקֽוֹל" (in a voice/sound). In the context of the Sinai theophany (Exodus 19-20), "קול" is strongly associated with thunder (e.g., Exodus 20:18 "הַקּוֹלֹת" explicitly refers to "the thunderings"). Thus, "God answered him in thunder" is a reasonable interpretation of the Hebrew. The act of "answering" implies communication, typically through a "voice." Identifying God\'s "voice" (the means of divine communication) with "thunder" (a powerful natural phenomenon) constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison. It\'s not that God *used* thunder as a separate tool, but that the *voice itself* was manifested as thunder. This direct identification of God\'s communicative "voice" with thunder functions as a metaphor. It conveys God\'s immense power and awe-inspiring presence in communication.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** Debated whether it could be considered literal (if "קול" is simply a literal sound God made, including thunder) or metonymy (thunder representing God\'s communication). However, the direct identification of "voice" with "thunder" leans more strongly towards metaphor, as "voice" implies a communicative function that thunder, by itself, does not inherently possess without this metaphorical mapping.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While divine anthropomorphisms are generally considered literal in this framework unless they refer to God\'s body, the specific action "break out" is a vivid cross-domain comparison that goes beyond a simple anthropomorphic action like "God went" or "God was angry." It describes *how* God\'s judgment manifests, likening it to an uncontrolled, destructive force.

Instead, "house" (בַּיִת) functions metaphorically to represent the entire system, institution, or condition of slavery and oppression in Egypt. The nation of Egypt, as a whole, is conceptualized as a "house" that confined and enslaved the Israelites. This is a clear cross-domain comparison (a nation/system likened to a house). Furthermore, "house of bondage" (בֵּית עֲבָדִים) is a well-established and frequently recurring phrase in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Exodus 20:2, Deuteronomy 5:6), making it a biblical idiom.

"Face" (פָּנִים) is a part of the body. While God is often described with human-like features, the phrase "upon My face" is not understood as referring to a literal physical face in the same way a human has one, especially for an incorporeal God. Instead, it conveys a deeper, non-physical meaning.\n        2.  **Idiom:** The phrase עַל־פָּנִים (al-panim) or עַל־פְּנֵי (al-p\'ney) is a well-established biblical Hebrew idiom meaning "in the presence of," "before," or "besides." When applied to God, as here, it signifies "in My presence" or "besides Me," indicating God\'s exclusive sphere of influence, direct observation, or unique authority, rather than a literal physical proximity to a divine facial feature. The English translation "besides Me" accurately captures this idiomatic sense.\n        3.  **Metonymy:** The "face" (פָּנִים) is used here to represent the *presence*, *person*, or *being* of God. This is a classic example of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part represents the whole). The physical part (face) stands for the abstract concept of divine presence or the entirety of God\'s being and authority. Therefore, it is a figurative use of language.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** The primary point of deliberation was whether to interpret "face" as a literal anthropomorphism (as per the general rule for divine anthropomorphisms) or as figurative due to its reference to a body part and its idiomatic usage. Given the explicit instruction to mark idioms as figurative and the fact that "face" here signifies presence/person rather than a literal physical feature, it is best classified as both an idiom and a metonymy.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This idiom signifies the misuse, profanation, or false invocation of God\'s name, particularly in oaths or for trivial purposes. It does not refer to a literal physical act of "carrying" a name.

This is a straightforward command, not a figurative expression.\n\n3.  **"אַתָּ֣ה&thinsp;׀ וּבִנְךָ֣͏ֽ־וּ֠בִתֶּ֗ךָ עַבְדְּךָ֤֨ וַאֲמָֽתְךָ֜֙ וּבְהֶמְתֶּ֔֗ךָ וְגֵרְךָ֖֙" (you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger):** This is a literal enumeration of the categories of individuals and animals who are subject to the Sabbath command. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or other figurative device at play here.\n\n4.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥֣ר בִּשְׁעָרֶֽ֔יךָ" (who is within your settlements / literally "in your gates"):** I considered if "in your gates" (בִּשְׁעָרֶֽיךָ) should be taken literally as referring only to the physical gates of a city. However, in ancient Near Eastern and biblical Hebrew contexts, the "gates" of a city (שערים) commonly represent the entire city, town, or settlement, as the gate was the primary place of public life, commerce, and justice. Therefore, "in your gates" functions as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part represents the whole) and a well-established idiom for "within your jurisdiction" or "within your community/settlements."

My reasoning is that this is a literal description of God\'s creative activity and the physical components of the cosmos. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or simile present here.\n\n2.  **"וַיָּ֖נַח בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֑י" (and then rested on the seventh day)**: I considered if "rested" (וַיָּנַח) is an anthropomorphism. According to the guidelines, "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The act of "resting" describes a cessation of activity, not a specific body part. In the ANE context, such descriptions of divine action are understood literally as God\'s engagement with the world. Therefore, I classify this as a literal statement of divine action.\n\n3.  **"בֵּרַ֧ךְ יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־י֥וֹם הַשַּׁבָּ֖ת" (יהוה blessed the sabbath day)**: I considered if "blessed the sabbath day" involves personification or is a figurative idiom.\n    *   **Personification**: While a "day" is an abstract concept of time, and "blessing" is an action often directed at animate beings or concrete objects, the act of God "blessing" a day in biblical theology means to imbue it with special status, sanctity, or favor. This is a direct theological action, not an "obvious" personification where the day is depicted with human-like qualities or actions. The day is the recipient of a divine decree, not an active participant.\n    *   **Figurative Idiom**: I compared this phrase to the examples provided for figurative idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground"). These examples involve clear metonymy or personification where the literal meaning is transformed. "Blessed the sabbath day" does not exhibit the same level of figurative transformation. God literally *does* bless the day by setting it apart and making it holy. It is a direct statement of divine action and its effect on the status of the day, rather than a phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from its literal components or that relies on a clear cross-domain comparison. Therefore, I do not classify it as a figurative idiom.\n\n4.  **"וַֽיְקַדְּשֵֽׁהוּ" (and hallowed it)**: Similar to "blessed," I considered if "hallowed it" (referring to the day) is figurative. "Hallowing" (קָדַשׁ) means to make something holy or set it apart for sacred use. This is a literal theological act of consecration performed by God upon the day, designating its sacred status.

While "lengthening days" isn\'t a literal physical stretching of time units, it is a very common and conventional expression in Biblical Hebrew for living a long life. It functions as a set phrase to denote longevity. According to the guidelines, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This fits the definition of an idiom perfectly, as it\'s a conventional expression whose meaning is not predictable from the literal meaning of its constituent elements. It is not hyperbole, as it\'s a direct promise of a long life, not an exaggeration. It is not a metaphor, as it doesn\'t compare "days" to something else in a cross-domain way, but rather uses a conventional linguistic shortcut to express duration. Therefore, I included it as an idiom.\n    *   **"on the land" (עַ֚ל הָאֲדָמָ֔ה):** This is a literal geographical reference.

However, "giving" or "assigning" is a literal action for God in the ANE context when bestowing land or blessings. The guidelines state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are LITERAL unless they refer to God\'s body. "Giving" is an action, not a reference to a body part, and is understood literally as God\'s act of bestowing.

In English, one typically "hears" thunder.

According to the instructions, divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are to be considered *literal* in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body parts (like "God\'s finger"). The phrase "God has come" refers to God\'s active presence or intervention, not a specific physical body part. Therefore, in this ANE context, it is understood literally as God\'s active presence and is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **"the fear of God may be ever with you" (תִּהְיֶ֧ה יִרְאָת֛וֹ עַל־פְּנֵיכֶ֖ם)**: I considered this phrase for idiom, metaphor, and metonymy. The literal Hebrew is "His fear upon your faces."\n    *   **Idiom**: The phrase "upon your faces" (עַל־פְּנֵיכֶ֖ם) or "before your faces" is a common biblical idiom signifying constant presence, awareness, or a visible reality. In this context, it means the fear of God should be a constant, guiding presence in their lives. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Metaphor**: The abstract concept of "fear" (יִרְאָת֛וֹ) is not a physical object that can literally be placed "upon faces." The "faces" (פְּנֵיכֶ֖ם) here serve as a vehicle to express the constant, inescapable presence and influence of this fear on the people\'s consciousness and actions. It\'s a cross-domain comparison where an abstract quality is treated as a physical entity present on a visible part of the body, representing the whole person\'s awareness. Therefore, it also functions as a metaphor.\n    Given the instructions to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type, and that it also functions as a clear metaphor, I will mark both.\n\n3.  **"so that you do not go astray" (לְבִלְתִּ֥י תֶחֱטָֽאוּ)**: I considered if the verb "to go astray" (תֶחֱטָֽאוּ, from חָטָא) is figurative. The root meaning of חָטָא is "to miss the mark" (e.g., in archery). When applied to moral or religious conduct, it signifies "to miss the mark" of righteousness, to err, or to sin. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison from a physical act (missing a target) to a moral failure (sinning). Although "to sin" is the standard translation and meaning in this context, the underlying conceptual mapping from a physical domain to an abstract moral domain makes it a metaphor. It is not merely standard narrative language in a literal sense, but a common, lexicalized metaphor. Therefore, it is marked as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

There is no cross-domain comparison or symbolic meaning intended beyond the physical material. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your sacrifices of well-being, your sheep and your oxen"**: I considered if the offerings themselves or the animals could be symbolic or metaphorical representations of something else.

In biblical Hebrew, "name" (שם, *shem*) often stands metonymically for the person, presence, reputation, authority, or essence of an individual, especially when referring to God. God\'s "name" is not merely a linguistic label but embodies His active presence, character, and authority. To "cause My name to be mentioned" means to establish a place where God\'s presence is acknowledged, invoked, and where His authority is manifested, rather than simply uttering a word. This is a classic example of metonymy where a part (the name) stands for the whole (God\'s person/presence/authority). It is also a well-established biblical idiom. Therefore, I have included this as figurative.\n\n4.  **"I will come to you" (אָב֥וֹא אֵלֶ֖יךָ)**: I considered this as a divine anthropomorphism. The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Coming" is an action attributed to God, not a reference to a specific body part. In the ANE worldview, God\'s "coming" signifies a real, albeit non-physical in a human sense, manifestation of His presence. Therefore, according to the guidelines, I have treated this as literal and excluded it as figurative.\n\n5.  **"and bless you" (וּבֵרַכְתִּֽיךָ)**: I considered if the act of "blessing" could be figurative. However, it describes a literal divine action—the bestowal of favor, prosperity, and well-being upon the people. There is no underlying comparison or symbolic meaning that would render it figurative. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "My name" is identified as figurative language (metonymy and idiom).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In ancient Hebrew, "sword" could sometimes refer more broadly to any sharp metal implement or tool, especially one used for cutting, shaping, or striking. In the context of stone working, it stands in for a "metal tool" or "chisel" used to shape the stones. The specific, well-known sharp metal object (sword) represents a broader category of sharp metal objects used for cutting/shaping (tools/chisels). The ground for this metonymy is the shared characteristic of being a sharp, metal implement used for cutting or shaping. This is a clear case of metonymy where a specific, prominent example of a sharp metal object stands for the general class of such objects used in this context.\n\n4.  **"you have profaned them" (וַתְּחַֽלְלֶֽהָ):** I considered if "profaned" was used figuratively.

However, in this specific cultic instruction, the primary meaning is literal. The prohibition against using steps is given precisely because ascending steps would require lifting the legs, which could physically expose the lower body beneath the priestly garments. This physical exposure of "nakedness" is what the instruction aims to prevent. The text is stating a direct, physical consequence of a physical action (ascending steps). While the *result* of this physical exposure would be shame, the word "nakedness" itself here refers to the literal physical state of being uncovered, not figuratively representing the abstract concept of shame. The instruction is to prevent the physical act that leads to the physical exposure. Therefore, this is a literal statement about preventing physical exposure.\n\n**Conclusion:** No figurative language is found in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

My reasoning for excluding it is that it is a straightforward, literal statement identifying the subject matter. It is standard narrative language and does not involve any cross-domain comparisons, personification, or idiomatic expressions.\n2.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר תָּשִׂ֖ים" (asher tasim) - "that you shall set/put"**: I considered if the verb שִׂים (sim), meaning "to put, place, set," when applied to abstract "rules" (מִשְׁפָּטִים), constituted a metaphor. While rules are not physical objects that can be literally "put" or "placed," this usage is a very common and conventional extension of the verb\'s meaning in Hebrew, akin to "establishing" or "laying down" rules in English. It is not a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparisons" but rather standard narrative language for the establishment of laws. Therefore, I excluded it as a standalone figurative element.\n3.  **"לִפְנֵיהֶֽם" (lifnehem) - "before them"**: I considered if this prepositional phrase, literally "to their faces," was figurative. While it refers to a physical part of the body (face), its common usage is to mean "in their presence" or "to them." This is a conventional spatial expression. However, when combined with the verb שִׂים, it forms a well-recognized idiom.\n4.  **"תָּשִׂ֖ים לִפְנֵיהֶֽם" (tasim lifnehem) - "you shall set before them"**: I considered this entire phrase as a potential idiom. The combination of שִׂים (sim, "to set/put") and לִפְנֵי (lifnei, "before/in the presence of") is a common biblical idiom meaning "to present, to lay before, to establish for." The literal sense of physically placing an object in front of someone\'s face is not the intended meaning. Instead, it conveys the act of making laws known, accessible, or established for the people. This fits the instruction to classify "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type. The "face" (פָּנִים) here is not personified in the sense of a non-human entity, but rather used as a conventional marker for presence or attention, contributing to the idiomatic meaning of the whole phrase. This is a clear instance of a set phrase whose meaning is not simply the sum of its literal parts, thus qualifying it as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

When used in the construct "בְּגַפּוֹ" (literally "in his wing" or "by his side") to denote a person\'s marital status or state of being unaccompanied, it is not a literal description of a physical attribute or action. Instead, it is a conventionalized expression in Biblical Hebrew that conveys the idea of being alone, without a spouse or family. This fixed, non-literal meaning makes it an idiom. It is not a metaphor because it doesn\'t compare the person to a wing; rather, it uses the term in an established, non-literal way. It is not metonymy in the sense of a part standing for a whole, but rather a fixed phrase whose meaning is not directly derivable from its constituent parts. Therefore, it is classified as an idiom.

The literal meaning of גַּף (gaf) can be "wing," "hand," or "side/edge." In this context, a literal translation like "he shall go out with his wing" makes no sense. While "he shall go out with his hand" or "with his body" could be interpreted literally as leaving with nothing but himself, the phrase "יֵצֵא בְגַפּוֹ" functions as a fixed legal expression in Exodus 21:2-4. It means to leave without any possessions or family acquired during servitude, essentially "alone" or "empty-handed" in the sense of not taking the wife and children provided by the master. This is a set phrase whose meaning is not immediately derivable from the individual words in a literal sense, especially given the ambiguity of גַּף in this context. It is a specific legal idiom indicating the slave\'s status upon release, signifying that he leaves as he came, without the family provided by the master.

The master is not literally bringing the slave into the physical presence of God, but rather before a human legal body that acts in God\'s name.

It is a comparison of function or behavior, not a cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile in the figurative sense intended by the rules.

It does not literally mean that "evil" is physically present *in* the master\'s eyes. Instead, "in the eyes of X" functions as a way to express "in the opinion of X," "in the judgment of X," or "displeasing to X." The "eyes" here represent the master\'s perception, favor, or disfavor.

While "faith" is an abstract concept, the verb "to break" in this context describes the *violation* or *severing* of that trust, not a literal physical fracture. It is a standard, non-figurative way to describe an act of betrayal or disloyalty in relational and legal contexts. It is not a cross-domain comparison but a direct description of a moral action.\n    *   **Decision:** Excluded as not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It describes the direct action involved in establishing a marital relationship.

While "food" can sometimes be used more broadly, in this list of specific provisions (food, clothing, conjugal rights), it is most directly interpreted as literal food.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n3.  **כְּסוּתָ֥הּ (her clothing)**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "clothing" might be a metonymy for dignity, protection, or status.\n    *   **Reasoning**: Similar to "food," "clothing" in this context refers literally to garments, another basic necessity a husband is obligated to provide. While clothing can carry symbolic weight in other contexts, here it is presented as a direct, material provision alongside food.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְעֹנָתָ֖הּ (or her conjugal rights / her ointments)**:\n    *   **Considered**: This phrase presents a potential ambiguity due to the alternative translation "ointments" and the possibility of euphemism.\n        *   If translated as "conjugal rights," it is a direct, literal term for a specific marital obligation.\n        *   If translated as "ointments," it refers to literal cosmetic or hygiene provisions.\n        *   I debated whether the Hebrew word עֹנָתָהּ itself might be a euphemism for sexual relations. A euphemism is a type of figurative language (often considered a form of metonymy where a related concept stands for the direct one).\n    *   **Reasoning**: Given the "STANDARD CONSERVATIVE" instruction and the emphasis on marking "clear metaphors," "personification," and "obvious similes," I must be cautious. The primary English translation provided, "conjugal rights," is a literal and direct term for the concept it describes. The alternative "ointments" is also a literal provision. While the *Hebrew word* might be debated by scholars regarding its etymology or potential euphemistic use, the *concept* conveyed by "conjugal rights" is a literal aspect of marital obligation. The text is giving a direct instruction about what must not be withheld. It is not a metaphor, simile, or personification. It does not fit the examples of biblical idioms provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword"). To classify it as figurative based on a potential euphemistic nuance of the Hebrew word itself, when the English translation provides a direct, literal concept, would go against the conservative approach. The instruction is about the figurative nature of the *text\'s meaning*, not necessarily every linguistic subtlety of the original Hebrew word choice if the resulting meaning is literal.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n5.  **לֹ֥א יִגְרָֽע (he must not withhold)**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "withhold" might be used in a figurative sense.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a direct, literal verb describing the action of not providing or holding back something. It is standard narrative language.\n    *   **Decision**: Not figurative.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on a conservative analysis, no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, or obvious idioms are present in this verse.

Therefore, "no silver" (אֵ֥ין כָּֽסֶף) directly and commonly signifies "no payment" or "without monetary compensation." This is a clear instance of metonymy, where the material (silver) stands for the concept (money/payment).

When combined with "לְיָד" (to the hand of), it signifies divine providence or the delivery of an event or person into someone\'s power, control, or sphere of influence. The "hand" (יד) in this context is not a literal physical hand receiving an object, but rather functions as a metonymy for agency, control, or the means through which an event occurs.

The phrase describes the act of killing (לְהׇרְג֣וֹ) and the manner in which it is done (בְעׇרְמָ֑ה, "with cunning/treachery"). This is a straightforward, literal description of the action and its method, falling under "Standard narrative language" and "Character actions." It is not a metaphor, simile, or idiom.\n\n3.  **מֵעִ֣ם מִזְבְּחִ֔י** (from My very altar): I considered if "My very altar" might be figurative. The altar (מִזְבֵּחַ) is a physical object, and the possessive suffix (-י) indicates God\'s ownership, which is a literal theological statement. The instruction is to physically remove someone from this specific, physical location. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning here. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **תִּקָּחֶ֖נּוּ לָמֽוּת** (you shall take that person... to be put to death): I considered if "to be put to death" (לָמֽוּת) could be figurative. This is a direct and literal statement of the prescribed legal consequence and action. It describes a literal outcome and does not employ any figurative devices such as metaphor, simile, or personification. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nIn conclusion, the entire verse functions as a legal instruction, using direct and literal language to describe a crime and its prescribed punishment. No clear metaphors, similes, personifications, or biblical idioms (as defined by the examples provided) were identified.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The construction "מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת" literally means "dying, he shall die" or "he shall surely die." Its meaning is direct and literal death; the construction serves as a grammatical device for emphasis and certainty, not to convey a non-literal meaning or a cross-domain comparison.

The victim is not necessarily physically clutched in the kidnapper\'s hand; rather, they are under the kidnapper\'s power or ownership. This phrase extends beyond the literal physical grip to denote a state of control or possession.

This grammatical structure functions as an idiom to emphasize the certainty and severity of the verb. While the outcome (physical death) is literal, the *way it is expressed* is an idiomatic intensification, literally meaning "dying, he shall die" or "he shall surely die." According to the guidelines, biblical idioms and set phrases should be classified as "idiom." This construction is a well-established idiomatic way to express emphatic certainty in Hebrew. Therefore, it is figurative as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies a state of incapacitation rather than merely the physical act of lying down. This fits the instruction to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom." It\'s a conventional expression for a specific state resulting from injury or illness.\n    *   Borderline case: One might argue it\'s literal because the person *does* physically lie in bed. However, the idiomatic force comes from the *consequence* and *state* implied – not just lying down, but being *forced* to lie down due to severe injury, indicating a period of recovery or incapacitation. This goes beyond a simple literal description of an action. Therefore, it is best classified as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

This is a well-established legal idiom in biblical Hebrew, where a physical state (cleanliness) is extended to a legal status (innocence/acquittal).

However, in this context, and generally in biblical Hebrew, it functions as an idiom. It does not refer to the slave literally dying *under* the master\'s physical hand, but rather signifies that the death occurs as a *direct result* of the master\'s action and *while under his immediate control or custody*, implying direct responsibility and immediacy. The English translation\'s footnote ("Lit. \'under his hand.\'") confirms its idiomatic nature, translating it as "there and then" to convey the immediacy and direct causation. This fits the guideline for classifying biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type.\n    *   Borderline cases: While it uses a spatial concept ("under the hand"), its conventional and fixed meaning in Hebrew for control, possession, or direct consequence makes "idiom" the most precise classification, as its meaning is not merely a novel comparison but a recognized set phrase.\n\n4.  **נָקֹ֖ם יִנָּקֵֽם** (this must be avenged)\n    *   Considered: If the concept of "avenging" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal statement of legal consequence and retribution. The infinitive absolute construction (`נָקֹם יִנָּקֵֽם`) serves to emphasize the certainty of the action, which is a grammatical feature for intensification, not figurative language.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n5.  **עָנ֣וֹשׁ יֵעָנֵ֗שׁ (he shall surely be fined):** I considered if the infinitive absolute construction (עָנ֣וֹשׁ יֵעָנֵ֗שׁ) is figurative. This is a common grammatical construction in Hebrew used for emphasis ("he shall be fined, indeed he shall be fined"). It is a literal statement of legal consequence and a standard grammatical feature, not figurative language. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n6.  **כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֨ר יָשִׁ֤ית עָלָיו֙ בַּ֣עַל הָֽאִשָּׁ֔ה (according as the woman\'s husband may exact upon him):** I considered if "exact upon him" (יָשִׁית עָלָיו) is an idiom for imposing a fine. However, יָשִׁית means "to lay, put, impose," making "to impose upon him" a literal description of the husband\'s right to determine the fine. Furthermore, the phrase "כַּֽאֲשֶׁר" (according as) indicates a proportional comparison, which the instructions explicitly state *not* to mark as figurative. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n7.  **וְנָתַ֖ן בִּפְלִלִֽים (and he shall give by judgment / the payment to be based on reckoning):** I considered if this phrase is an idiom. The literal translation "and he shall give in/by judges" or "in/by judgments" does not fully convey the intended legal meaning. The phrase implies that the payment, though initially exacted by the husband, must be *ratified* or *determined* by a judicial process or by judges. This specialized legal meaning, where the phrase functions to indicate judicial oversight or determination of the fine, is not directly deducible from the literal meaning of "give in judges." This fits the definition of an idiom, as it has a conventional, non-literal meaning within a specific legal context. Therefore, I included it as figurative (idiom).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The instructions specify: "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify *figurative* idioms as \'idiom\' type." The examples provided for *figurative* idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground") clearly involve figurative devices like metonymy or personification, where the literal meaning of the words does not directly convey the intended sense. In contrast, "נֶ֖פֶשׁ תַּ֥חַת נָֽפֶשׁ" literally means "a life in place of a life." The meaning is direct and transparent; one physical life is exchanged for another as a penalty. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile. Therefore, while it is a fixed legal phrase, it does not meet the criteria for being a *figurative* idiom as per the provided examples and conservative guidelines.\n    *   **Reasoning for Metonymy (and why it\'s not marked):** "נֶ֖פֶשׁ" can carry meanings such as "soul," "life," or "person." One might argue that if "נֶ֖פֶשׁ" is interpreted as "soul," it could be metonymic for the "person" or "physical life." However, "נֶ֖פֶשׁ" also directly and commonly means "life" (physical existence) in many biblical contexts (e.g., "to save a life," "to seek a life"). In the context of *lex talionis*, the phrase refers to the physical existence of a person being taken as a penalty. Since "life" is a primary and direct meaning of "נֶ֖פֶשׁ" in this context, and the phrase directly states the equivalence of lives, it is not a substitution of an attribute for the thing meant in a way that creates a figurative sense beyond the literal. Adhering to the conservative guidelines, and given the directness of the meaning, it is not marked as metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning for other figurative types:** There is no clear metaphor (no cross-domain comparison), personification (no non-human entity given human qualities), or obvious simile (no explicit comparison using "like" or "as").\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of the guidelines, and the direct, literal meaning of the phrase "life for life," no genuinely figurative language is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While some ancient Near Eastern legal codes might have had literal applications in certain contexts, the broader biblical legal framework and subsequent interpretations often understand "lex talionis" (the law of retaliation) as a principle of *proportional justice* or *equivalent compensation* rather than always a direct physical mutilation. For instance, other laws in the Torah allow for monetary compensation for injuries. This suggests that the body part itself is not always the literal object of exchange.\n\n2.  **Metonymy/Synecdoche:** Given the above, I considered if the body parts (eye, tooth, hand, foot) function as **synecdoche**, which is a type of metonymy. In this context, the "eye" (or tooth, hand, foot) stands for the *injury inflicted upon that body part* (e.g., loss of sight, loss of a tooth, incapacitation of a hand/foot) and, by extension, the *equivalent recompense or retribution* for that specific injury. It\'s a part (the body part) representing the whole concept of the injury and its just consequence. This is a clear figurative use, as the body part itself is not the ultimate target of the law, but rather the harm done to it and the principle of equivalent justice.\n\n3.  **Idiom:** I also considered if these phrases constitute a **biblical idiom** or set phrase. "Eye for eye" is a well-established legal maxim (lex talionis) that encapsulates a principle of reciprocal justice. The instructions specify that biblical idioms and set phrases should be classified as "idiom" type, especially if they are figurative. The concise, formulaic repetition of "X for X" clearly functions as a fixed expression conveying a specific legal principle that goes beyond the mere sum of its literal words. The underlying figurative mechanism (synecdoche) contributes to its idiomatic nature.\n\n4.  **Other Figurative Types:** I did not identify any clear metaphors (no cross-domain comparison), similes (no "like" or "as"), personification (non-human entities not acting human), or hyperbole (not an exaggeration, but a statement of principle).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The phrases are best understood as both an **idiom** and employing **metonymy** (specifically synecdoche). The body part represents the injury and the principle of proportional justice.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 4, 'instances_recovered': 4, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The meaning "in place of his eye" or "as compensation for his eye" is directly deducible from the individual words `תַּחַת` (in place of/on account of) and `עֵינֽוֹ` (his eye). The eye is literally lost, and freedom is literally granted *in exchange for* or *on account of* that literal loss. This is a literal statement of a legal consequence or a direct causal relationship, not a figurative expression where the meaning deviates from the sum of its parts.

The text describes a direct physical action and its direct physical object. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or substitution of a part for a whole (metonymy/synecdoche) that would render these figurative.\n\n2.  **לַֽחׇפְשִׁ֥י יְשַׁלְּחֶ֖נּוּ** ("that person shall let the slave go free")\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "לַֽחׇפְשִׁ֥י" (to freedom/as a free person) or "יְשַׁלְּחֶ֖נּוּ" (shall let him go/send him away) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These terms describe a literal change in legal status and a literal action of release. They are standard narrative language for describing freedom and the act of setting someone free. No figurative meaning is present.\n\n3.  **תַּ֥חַת שִׁנּֽוֹ** ("on account of the tooth" / literally "under his tooth" or "in place of his tooth")\n    *   **Considered:** Whether this phrase constitutes an idiom or a metaphor. The literal translation "under his tooth" might initially seem unusual in English, prompting a check for figurative meaning.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Hebrew preposition תַּחַת (tachat) commonly means "under," "beneath," but also "instead of," "in place of," or "on account of" in contexts of exchange, compensation, or causality. In legal texts, particularly in the context of "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" (עַיִן תַּחַת עַיִן, שֵׁן תַּחַת שֵׁן), תַּחַת clearly denotes "in place of" or "as compensation for." Therefore, "תַּחַת שִׁנּוֹ" means "in place of his tooth" or "as compensation for his tooth." This is a standard, literal usage of the preposition to express a compensatory relationship, not a figurative idiom where the meaning is detached from the literal words, nor a metaphor involving a cross-domain comparison. It directly states the reason/basis for the slave\'s release.\n\n**Conclusion:** After careful examination of each component, I find no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or idioms as defined by the provided guidelines.

However, "goring" is the precise and literal action of an ox using its horns. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended here; it describes a direct physical action.

However, the context is a legal stipulation concerning a fatal incident. "To death" is the literal and factual outcome that triggers the subsequent legal consequences. There is no exaggeration; the text describes a literal fatality. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n3.  **סָק֨וֹל יִסָּקֵ֜ל הַשּׁ֗וֹר** ("the ox shall be stoned"): I considered if this phrase constituted personification, as an animal is being subjected to a human legal punishment (execution by stoning). While it is unusual for an animal to be "punished" in a human legal sense, the act of stoning itself is a literal physical execution performed *on* the ox. The text does not attribute human qualities, thoughts, or actions to the ox beyond its capacity to cause harm. The infinitive absolute construction (`סָקוֹל יִסָּקֵל`) emphasizes the certainty and severity of the stoning, which is a grammatical device for emphasis, not a figurative one.

In this legal context, the owner\'s *life* is forfeit, meaning the *owner himself* would be put to death. The payment of "פִּדְיֹ֣ן נַפְשׁ֔וֹ" (redemption of his nefesh) is therefore a payment to redeem the owner *himself* from death. This usage of "נֶפֶשׁ" to represent the person is a common biblical idiom and a clear instance of synecdoche, which is a type of metonymy. It\'s a set phrase describing the legal act of saving the person\'s life by means of a payment.\n    *   Borderline cases: One could argue that "redeem his life" is a literal description of saving biological existence. However, the extensive semantic range and idiomatic use of "נֶפֶשׁ" for the person, especially in contexts of forfeiture or redemption, strongly suggest a synecdochic function. The payment is not merely for an abstract concept of "life" but for the *person* whose life is at stake.\n\n3.  **כְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־יוּשַׁ֖ת עָלָֽיו** (according to all that is imposed upon him):\n    *   Considered if "according to all" (כְּכֹ֥ל) might be a figurative comparison.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a proportional comparison, which the instructions explicitly state should *never* be marked as figurative ("NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons...").

It is a straightforward legal requirement for restitution.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְהַמֵּ֖ת יִֽהְיֶה־לּֽוֹ (vehammet yihyeh-llo) - "but keeping the dead animal":**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "the dead (animal) shall be his" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal statement regarding the transfer of ownership of the deceased animal. After restitution is paid, the one who caused the death takes possession of the carcass. This is a direct legal outcome, not a figurative expression.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe entire verse functions as a clear, concise legal statute. It uses standard, literal language to describe responsibilities, actions, and outcomes in a specific legal scenario. There are no clear metaphors, similes, personifications, hyperboles, or metonymies present.

However, the legal context clearly focuses on the animal itself as the agent of injury and the object of injury, and later as the item to be sold and divided. The text is concerned with the property (the ox) and its direct actions, not solely the owner\'s responsibility through metonymy. Therefore, this is literal.\n    *   I considered if the verb "יִגֹּ֧ף" (injures/strikes) could imply personification by suggesting malicious intent or a human-like action. However, "נגף" (nagāp̄) is a common verb for an animal striking or goring, and in this legal context, it describes a physical action an ox performs. There is no indication of human-like will or emotion attributed to the ox beyond its physical capability. Thus, this is literal.\n\n2.  **"וָמֵ֑ת" (and it dies)**\n    *   I considered if "dies" could be a euphemism or a figurative way of describing the end of the ox. However, the death of the ox is a literal, physical event that is the central outcome triggering the legal stipulations. It is a direct statement of fact. Therefore, this is literal.\n\n3.  **"וּמָ֨כְר֜וּ אֶת־הַשּׁ֤וֹר הַחַי֙ וְחָצ֣וּ אֶת־כַּסְפּ֔וֹ" (they shall sell the live ox and divide its price)**\n    *   I considered if "הַשּׁ֤וֹר הַחַי֙" (the live ox) or "כַּסְפּ֔וֹ" (its price/money) could be figurative. Both are literal descriptions of the animal that survived and the monetary value obtained from its sale. The actions of "מָכְר֜וּ" (selling) and "חָצ֣וּ" (dividing) are also literal human actions in a commercial transaction. Therefore, this is literal.\n\n4.  **"וְגַ֥ם אֶת־הַמֵּ֖ת יֶֽחֱצֽוּן" (they shall also divide the dead animal)**\n    *   I considered if "הַמֵּ֖ת" (the dead animal) could be figurative. It is a literal reference to the carcass of the deceased ox. The action of "יֶֽחֱצֽוּן" (dividing) is a literal action, referring to the physical division of the carcass or its value (e.g., for hide, meat, or other salvageable parts) between the parties. Therefore, this is literal.\n\nConclusion: After a thorough examination of each phrase against the provided guidelines, I find no instances of figurative language in this verse.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative language.\n2.  **"מִתְּמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם" (from yesterday and the day before / habitually)**: I considered whether this phrase should be interpreted literally as referring to two specific past days or idiomatically. While its literal components mean "from yesterday, the day before yesterday," in biblical Hebrew, this phrase functions as a common temporal idiom to express a continuous, habitual, or long-standing state or action, rather than just two discrete days.

It is standard, literal narrative language describing the perpetrator.\n2.  **שׁ֣וֹר אוֹ־שֶׂ֔ה** (an ox or a sheep): These are literal animals, the objects of the theft.

It is not referring to literal multiple quantities of blood, but rather the legal and moral responsibility associated with bloodshed. This functions as both an idiom and a metonymy, where the physical "bloods" (the consequence of violence) stand for the abstract "bloodguilt" (the legal status).

However, this is a standard grammatical construction in Hebrew used for emphasis or intensification of the verbal action. It literally means "being found, it is found," conveying certainty or strong condition. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison, personification, or an exaggeration beyond belief, nor does its meaning deviate from the sum of its parts in an idiomatic way. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"בְיָד֜וֹ" (b\'yado) - "in his hand"**: I considered if this phrase might be metonymy, where "hand" represents possession or control, or if it functions as an idiom. While "hand" can sometimes be used metonymically for power or agency, in this specific legal context ("if what was stolen... is found alive and in hand"), it refers quite literally to the physical presence or immediate possession/control of the stolen item by the individual. The meaning of "possession" is a direct and common extension of the literal act of holding or having something physically. It is not a clear cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or an obvious simile. Furthermore, the examples provided for idioms (e.g., "mouth of the sword," "face of the ground") represent phrases whose meaning is clearly non-literal and not deducible from their individual components. "In his hand" for possession is much closer to a literal extension of meaning than these examples.

However, the verb בָּעַר (ba\'ar) can mean "to consume" or "to graze," and it is common in Hebrew to use the land itself as the direct object when referring to its produce being consumed by animals. This is a literal description of the action and its effect on the field, not a figurative one. The English translation clarifies the nuance by adding "lets it loose to graze in another\'s land," but the Hebrew is direct and literal in its expression of the action.\n\n2.  **וְשִׁלַּח֙ אֶת־בְּעִירֹ֔ה (and lets loose his livestock)**: This is a straightforward description of a character\'s action. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **וּבִעֵ֖ר בִּשְׂדֵ֣ה אַחֵ֑ר (and so allows a field or a vineyard to be grazed bare)**: Similar to the first point, "וּבִעֵ֖ר" (and he causes to graze/consume) describes the literal action of the livestock causing damage to another\'s field.

The restitution is to be made *according to the standard of* the best part/value of the field or vineyard. This is a precise legal term specifying the extent of compensation required, ensuring that the owner is compensated for the full potential or original value of the damaged property. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), personification, or obvious simile. It also does not fit the definition of an idiom as a set phrase with a meaning not deducible from its individual words, as "the best of X" literally means the best quality/value of X. The English translation\'s interpretive gloss of "impairment" is a way to convey the *effect* of the damage, but the Hebrew itself is specifying the *standard* of restitution in a literal sense.

It does not attribute human-like qualities or intentionality to the fire, but rather describes its natural behavior. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וּמָצְאָ֤ה קֹצִים֙** (and spreads to thorns / and finds thorns):\n    *   **Considered:** If `מָצְאָה` ("finds") when applied to fire constitutes personification.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the previous point, while "finds" is typically associated with animate beings, in this context, it describes the fire\'s natural progression and encounter with flammable material (thorns). It means the fire reaches or encounters the thorns, not that it consciously seeks them out. This is a common way to describe an inanimate force interacting with its environment in Hebrew. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְנֶאֱכַ֣ל גָּדִ֔ישׁ א֥וֹ הַקָּמָ֖ה** (so that stacked, standing grain is consumed / and a stack of grain is eaten, or the standing grain):\n    *   **Considered:** If `וְנֶאֱכַ֣ל` ("and is eaten" or "is consumed") when referring to grain destroyed by fire is a metaphor or idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Fire does not literally "eat" in the biological sense of ingesting and digesting food. However, the verb `אכל` ("to eat") is frequently used in biblical Hebrew to describe complete destruction by fire, plague, sword, or other destructive forces. This constitutes a clear cross-domain comparison: the physical consumption of food by an organism is used to describe the complete destruction and disappearance of material by fire. This is a well-established idiom for destruction by fire and therefore is marked as both an idiom and a metaphor.\n\n4.  **א֣וֹ הַשָּׂדֶ֑ה** (or growing grain / or the field):\n    *   **Considered:** If `הַשָּׂדֶ֑ה` ("the field") is used figuratively to refer to the crops within it.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The preceding phrases refer to specific forms of grain (`גָּדִ֔ישׁ` - stacked grain, `הַקָּמָ֖ה` - standing grain). The addition of "or the field" implies that the *contents* of the field (i.e., the growing crops) are what is being consumed, not the soil itself. This is a common rhetorical device where a container or location is used to represent its contents. This is a form of metonymy, specifically synecdoche (the place for what is in the place). The English translation note "growing Lit. “field.” grain" also supports this interpretation.\n\n5.  **שַׁלֵּ֣ם יְשַׁלֵּ֔ם הַמַּבְעִ֖ר אֶת־הַבְּעֵרָֽה** (the one who started the fire must make restitution / he shall surely pay, the one who started the fire):\n    *   **Considered:** If any part of this phrase is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** `שַׁלֵּ֣ם יְשַׁלֵּ֔ם` is an infinitive absolute construction used for emphasis ("he shall surely pay" or "he must make full restitution"), which is a grammatical feature, not figurative language. The rest of the phrase literally describes the person responsible for starting the fire and their obligation.

However, in the ANE context, "drawing near to God" often refers to a literal physical approach to a sacred space (e.g., the sanctuary, altar) where an oath would be sworn in the divine presence, often before priests who represented God. The English translation "depose before God" captures this legal/ritualistic action. Given the instruction to treat divine anthropomorphisms as literal unless referring to God\'s body, and the context of a legal procedure, this is best understood as a literal ritual action of approaching the divine presence (or its representation) for an oath. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n3.  **"אִם־לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֛ח יָד֖וֹ בִּמְלֶ֥אכֶת רֵעֵֽהוּ" (and deny laying hands on the other’s property / if he has not sent his hand into the property of his neighbor)**: I considered "שָׁלַ֛ח יָד֖וֹ" (sent his hand / laying hands).

It refers to a judicial process where the matter is brought before human judges who act as representatives of divine authority, or to a sacred place (like a sanctuary) where an oath is taken or divine judgment is invoked. It does not signify a literal physical journey to God\'s heavenly presence. The "coming" is of the "matter" (דְּבַר), not a physical movement of the parties to God\'s person.

However, this is a standard, literal way to describe a transaction between two individuals in ancient Hebrew legal and narrative contexts. It is not a figurative idiom, but rather a direct statement of the parties involved.\n\n2.  **"חֲמ֨וֹר אוֹ־שׁ֥וֹר אוֹ־שֶׂ֛ה וְכׇל־בְּהֵמָ֖ה" (an ass, an ox, a sheep or any other animal):** This is a literal enumeration of types of livestock. There is no indication of metaphor, metonymy, or any other figurative device here.

This is a literal description of harm.\n\n6.  **"אוֹ־נִשְׁבָּ֖ה" (or is carried off/taken captive):** This was the most carefully considered phrase. The verb שׁבה (shavah) often refers to taking human captives in war. However, in the context of property, especially livestock, it is used literally to mean "to be taken away," "stolen," or "carried off" by an external force (e.g., raiders, thieves). While the semantic range of "captive" might evoke personification if applied to an animal in a different context, here it functions as a direct, non-figurative description of the animal being removed from the guardian\'s possession against their will, similar to how property might be "taken." It is a standard legal term for loss due to theft or being driven away, not personification.\n\n7.  **"אֵ֥ין רֹאֶֽה" (with no witness about / there is no one seeing):** This is a straightforward, literal statement about the absence of an observer, which is a crucial detail in ancient legal proceedings regarding liability. No figurative language is used.\n\nIn conclusion, after a thorough review of each phrase and concept, I have determined that the text uses standard narrative and legal language to describe a factual scenario.

Attributing the action of "deciding" (a cognitive, volitional act typically performed by a person) to an abstract concept like an "oath" is a form of personification. The oath itself does not possess the faculty of decision-making, but it is presented as the agent that brings about the resolution of the dispute. This is a borderline case, as it could be argued as a functional attribution rather than full personification. However, given the instruction to mark "Personification of non-human entities" and "decide" being a human action, it fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **"שָׁלַ֛ח יָד֖וֹ" (laid hands / sent his hand):**\n    *   Considered: If this phrase is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a well-established biblical idiom meaning to interfere with, harm, or take possession of something. It does not refer to a literal "sending" of a detached hand, but rather to the action performed by the person using their hand. It functions as a concise way to express a specific type of action (e.g., stealing, damaging, seizing). As per the guidelines, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom" type. It also contains an element of metonymy, where "hand" stands for the action performed by the hand or the person.\n\n4.  **"בִּמְלֶ֣אכֶת רֵעֵ֑הוּ" (on the property of the other):**\n    *   Considered: If "מְלֶ֣אכֶת" (work/property) is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal reference to the neighbor\'s possessions or livelihood.

While the phrase implies custody, it is a direct and literal way of stating the source of the theft from the person entrusted with the animal.

This is a concrete event with specific legal implications. The infinitive absolute construction (infinitive absolute + finite verb) is a common grammatical device in Hebrew used for emphasis, certainty, or intensity of the action (e.g., "it will *surely* be torn" or "it will *indeed* be torn"). While it intensifies the statement, it does not introduce a non-literal meaning or cross-domain comparison. It describes the literal action with emphasis, not figuratively.

The verb "בא" (came) is used here in a non-literal sense to describe the *state* or *condition* of the financial transaction, rather than a physical movement of the animal carrying money. This non-literal usage, where the phrase functions as a concise legal shorthand for a specific financial arrangement, qualifies it as an idiom.

However, in this legal context, "sorceress" refers literally to a person practicing witchcraft. There is no indication of a cross-domain comparison or a part representing a whole. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **לֹ֥א תְחַיֶּֽה (you shall not let live / you shall not tolerate):** This is the core phrase to examine.\n    *   **Literal meaning:** The Hebrew verb חיה (chayah) in the Hiphil (תְחַיֶּֽה) means "to cause to live," "to preserve alive," or "to let live." Thus, "לֹ֥א תְחַיֶּֽה" literally translates to "you shall not cause to live," "you shall not preserve alive," or "you shall not let live."\n    *   **Consideration as an idiom:** I considered if this phrase functions as an idiom for "execute" or "put to death." While it is a common legal formulation in the Torah implying capital punishment (e.g., Exodus 22:19, Deuteronomy 20:16), its meaning is quite direct and predictable from the literal words. If one is commanded "not to let someone live," the direct consequence and implied action in a legal context is to cause their death or execute them. This is not like the examples of idioms provided (e.g., "mouth of the sword" where "mouth" is clearly non-literal). The concept of "life" is literal here.\n    *   **Consideration as euphemism:** While "you shall not let live" might be considered slightly less blunt than "you shall kill," it is still a very direct command with a clear and immediate implication of capital punishment in the ANE legal context.

The English translation "tolerate" is an interpretive rendering of the *implication* of the command (i.e., if you don\'t let her live, you certainly don\'t tolerate her), but the Hebrew itself directly addresses the preservation of life.

The context of "with a beast" and the severe penalty of death clearly indicates that the act referred to is sexual intercourse, not merely lying down.

However, "חרם" is a technical term in biblical law and warfare, denoting a literal state of being devoted to destruction, put under a ban, or utterly destroyed. It describes a specific legal/religious consequence with direct, often physical, implications (e.g., destruction of property, execution).

This is a factual statement about their past identity and experience. It is not a cross-domain comparison where "stranger" is used to describe something else.

The act of crying out itself is a literal human action expressing distress. The phrase "to Me" (אֵלַ֔י) refers to God. God\'s ability to be cried out to and to hear is a divine anthropomorphism. The instructions explicitly state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)."

It is a literal reference to the object being lent, not a figurative representation of a broader concept. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"אֶת־עַמִּ֗י" (to My people):** I considered if "My people" is a figurative way of referring to the Israelites, perhaps a synecdoche for the nation. This is a direct, literal possessive statement by God identifying the Israelites as His chosen group. It is a standard and literal way of referring to them. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"אֶת־הֶֽעָנִי֙ עִמָּ֔ךְ" (to the poor among you):** I considered if "the poor" could be a metonymy for those in need or a specific social class. This is a literal description of a specific demographic within "My people," referring directly to their economic status. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"לֹא־תִהְיֶ֥ה ל֖וֹ כְּנֹשֶׁ֑ה" (do not act toward them as a creditor / you shall not be to him like a creditor):** I considered if "כְּנֹשֶׁה" (like a creditor) constitutes a simile. The phrase uses the comparative particle "כְּ" (like/as). However, the instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function, such as \'a prophet like myself\' (כָּמֹנִי) or \'a prophet like yourself\' (כָּמוֹךָ). These are literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function, not figurative similes." The instruction here is about the *role* and *function* of a lender when dealing with the poor, specifically that they should *not* adopt the typical *role* or *function* of a creditor (i.e., demanding interest or acting harshly). This is a literal instruction about how to conduct oneself within a specific social role, contrasting it with the typical behavior associated with that role. It is not a cross-domain comparison.

"נֶשֶׁךְ" literally means "bite" or "sting." In this context, it is used to refer to "interest" on a loan. This is a clear example of a lexicalized metaphor, where the literal meaning of "bite" (implying pain, harm, or diminution) is transferred to the concept of interest, which "bites" into the borrower\'s resources.

The instruction explicitly states to "MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Personification of non-human entities." Despite its conventionality, the attribution of "coming" to the sun fits this definition. The sun does not literally "come" or "enter" in the same way a person or animal does; its apparent movement is due to the Earth\'s rotation. Therefore, this is a case of personification.\n    *   **Borderline Debate:** This was a borderline case because of its conventional usage. One could argue that it has become so conventional that its personifying force is lost, making it effectively a literal description of a natural event, similar to how "the wind blows" is not typically marked as personification.

There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or non-literal meaning. It is standard narrative language describing a physical object and its direct purpose. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **בַּמֶּ֣ה יִשְׁכָּ֔ב** (In what else shall [your neighbor] sleep?):\n    *   Considered: If this rhetorical question implies any figurative meaning.\n    *   Reasoning: While a rhetorical question, the question itself is about a literal action (sleeping) and a literal object (clothing). Rhetorical questions are a stylistic device, but not a type of figurative language (like metaphor, simile, personification) as defined by the instructions. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **כִּֽי־יִצְעַ֣ק אֵלַ֔י** (if that person cries out to Me):\n    *   Considered: If "cries out to Me" is a metaphor for prayer or a metonymy for seeking help.\n    *   Reasoning: While "crying out" (צעק) can sometimes be used in a broader sense for prayer or supplication, in this context, it refers to a direct, audible expression of distress or an appeal for help from a person in need. It is a literal action of vocalizing a plea. The "Me" refers to God, which is a literal reference. This is standard narrative language describing a character\'s action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **וְשָׁמַעְתִּ֖י** (I will pay heed / I will hear):\n    *   Considered: If God "hearing" is a metonymy for God "responding" or "acting."\n    *   Reasoning: The instructions state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Hearing" is an action attributed to God. While it implies more than mere auditory perception (i.e., it implies attention and response), it is treated as a literal anthropomorphic action in the ANE context according to the guidelines. It does not involve a clear cross-domain comparison, personification of a non-human entity, or an obvious simile. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **כִּֽי־חַנּ֥וּן אָֽנִי** (for I am compassionate):\n    *   Considered: If this statement about God\'s attribute is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a direct, literal statement describing God\'s inherent nature or quality.

However, in this context, "God" refers directly and literally to the divine being, the object of the prohibition against reviling. This is not a metaphor, metonymy, or any other form of figurative language.\n2.  **לֹ֣א תְקַלֵּ֑ל (you shall not revile/curse):** I considered if the act of "reviling" or "cursing" could be an idiom or a metaphor for a deeper spiritual transgression beyond the literal act of speaking. However, "תְקַלֵּל" is a direct and literal verb describing a specific verbal action. The commandment prohibits the literal act of speaking ill of or cursing. This is not figurative.\n3.  **וְנָשִׂ֥יא (and a chieftain/prince):** I considered if "chieftain" might be a metonymy for the office or authority rather than the person, or a metaphor for leadership in general.

However, "מְלֵאָה" is a standard, literal term for the first and best of the harvest, representing a specific type of offering. It is a concrete noun with a direct meaning in this agricultural context. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"וְדִמְעֲךָ֖" (v\'dim\'akha) - "and your tear" (interpreted as "and your first drippings/yield")**:\n    *   **What I considered**: I considered if the Hebrew word דִּמְעָה (dim\'ah), which literally means "tear" (as in human tears), could be a metaphor, metonymy, or personification when used in the context of agricultural produce (specifically the first liquid yield from a press).\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion**: The literal meaning of דִּמְעָה is "tear," a human bodily fluid. Its application here to the first, precious liquid yield from a winepress or olive press constitutes a cross-domain comparison. The "drippings" from the press are not literally tears, but they share the characteristic of being small, precious drops of liquid, similar to human tears. This usage is best classified as metonymy, where "tear" (a characteristic product of weeping) stands for the "first drippings" (the characteristic first product of the press) due to their shared physical appearance and perceived preciousness. This is a clear instance of a word from the human domain being applied to the natural/agricultural domain.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: I debated whether this was a specialized technical term that had lost its figurative force, or if it was a subtle personification of the press "weeping" its yield. However, the direct use of "tear" for a non-human liquid product, based on visual similarity and preciousness, strongly points to metonymy. While not an "obvious simile" with a comparative particle, it fits the criteria for a "clear metaphor with cross-domain comparison" (metonymy being a type of figurative language closely related to metaphor).\n\n3.  **"לֹ֣א תְאַחֵ֑ר" (lo\' te\'akher) - "you shall not put off/delay"**: This is a direct, literal command regarding the timing of the offering. I considered if "putting off" could be a metaphor for neglecting, but it is a straightforward instruction about not delaying. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"בְּכ֥וֹר בָּנֶ֖יךָ תִּתֶּן־לִֽי" (b\'khor baneykha titten-li) - "You shall give Me the male first-born among your children"**: This is a direct, literal command from God regarding the offering of the firstborn. There is no figurative language present. Therefore, I concluded it is not figurative.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "וְדִמְעֲךָ֖" is identified as figurative language.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It is a literal reference to specific types of animals, not a part standing for a whole or a general category. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָמִים֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה עִם־אִמּ֔וֹ" (seven days it shall remain with its mother):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "seven days" or "remain with its mother" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Seven days" is a literal duration of time.

The guidelines state that "Divine anthropomorphisms (e.g. God went, God was angry, God watched, God fought) - these are LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The act of "receiving" or being "given to" is an anthropomorphic action attributed to God. However, it does not refer to a specific body part of God (like a hand or finger). In the ANE context, commands to "give to God" are understood as literal religious acts of dedication or sacrifice. Therefore, according to the provided rules, this anthropomorphic action is to be treated as literal, not figurative. It is not a metaphor (God is not *like* a recipient, but *is* the recipient in this theological framework), nor is it a metonymy (it\'s a direct command, not a stand-in for a related concept like "for My service" which would be an interpretation of the *purpose* rather than the *act* itself).\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of the text and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language is present in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It means "set apart" or "consecrated" for God\'s service, defining the identity and role of the Israelites. It is not a comparison to something else, nor is it an idiom. The phrase "to Me" simply indicates the recipient or beneficiary of this holiness, a literal statement of relationship and divine ownership.\n    *   **Exclusion:** This is a direct command establishing a literal theological and relational status, not a figurative expression.\n\n2.  **"וּבָשָׂ֨ר בַּשָּׂדֶ֤ה טְרֵפָה֙ לֹ֣א תֹאכֵ֔לוּ" (you must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "flesh torn by beasts" (בַּשָּׂדֶ֤ה טְרֵפָה֙) could be a figurative description.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "טְרֵפָה" (terephah) is a specific, literal term in biblical and later Jewish law referring to an animal that has been mortally wounded by another animal, rendering its meat ritually unfit for consumption. The phrase describes the physical condition of the meat and its origin (in the field) in a factual manner. The prohibition against eating it is a direct, literal command.\n    *   **Exclusion:** This is a literal description of a type of meat and a literal dietary restriction.\n\n3.  **"לַכֶּ֖לֶב תַּשְׁלִכ֥וּן אֹתֽוֹ" (you shall cast it to the dogs):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "cast it to the dogs" might be an idiom for utter worthlessness or contempt, or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While "dogs" can sometimes carry negative connotations in biblical literature, in this specific context, the instruction appears to be a literal and practical command for the disposal of meat that is unfit for human consumption. Dogs were common scavengers in ancient Israel, and giving them refuse was a practical means of disposal. The text does not liken the meat *to* a dog, nor does it use the act of giving it to dogs as a symbolic representation of something else. It is a straightforward instruction for what to do with the ritually impure meat.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** I debated if the act of giving something to dogs, rather than burying or burning it, inherently implies a figurative sense of worthlessness. However, the primary meaning remains literal disposal. The instruction is about a physical action with a physical object, not a symbolic statement about the meat\'s intrinsic value beyond its ritual impurity. The guidelines instruct to be conservative with "standard narrative language" and "character actions," and this falls under a literal instruction for action.\n    *   **Exclusion:** This is a literal instruction for the disposal of the meat, not a figurative expression.\n\nBased on this thorough analysis, I find no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or idioms that meet the criteria for being marked as figurative language in this verse.

It is a standard biblical idiom for disseminating information. It does not create a novel or surprising cross-domain comparison that would classify it as a clear metaphor. Therefore, I am classifying it as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: It could be argued as a "dead metaphor" that has become idiomatic. However, the instructions specify to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type, which this fits perfectly.\n\n2.  **אַל־תָּ֤שֶׁת יָֽדְךָ֙ עִם־רָשָׁ֔ע** (al-tashet yadkha \'im rasha\') - "you shall not join hands with the guilty"\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if the phrase "to put your hand with" (תָּ֤שֶׁת יָֽדְךָ֙ עִם - *tashet yadkha \'im*) is a metaphor or metonymy for cooperation or alliance.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a well-established idiom in Hebrew for forming an alliance, cooperating, or making common cause with someone. It implies a commitment to act together, not a literal physical joining of hands. It is a conventional expression that signifies agreement or partnership, often in a negative context as here (with a wicked person). Therefore, I am classifying it as an idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases**: Similar to the first phrase, it\'s a conventional expression that functions as an idiom rather than a fresh metaphor.\n\n3.  **לִהְיֹ֖ת עֵ֥ד חָמָֽס** (lihyot \'ed hamas) - "to act as a malicious witness" / "to be a witness of violence/wrong"\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if "witness of violence" (עֵ֥ד חָמָֽס - *\'ed hamas*) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: חָמָס (*hamas*) means violence, wrong, or injustice. An "עֵד חָמָס" is a witness whose testimony is false or malicious, thereby causing injustice or harm. This is a direct, descriptive phrase indicating the nature or consequence of the witness\'s testimony. It is not a comparison or personification, but a literal description of the witness\'s role in perpetrating injustice. Therefore, I am not marking it as figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, I have identified two instances of figurative language, both classified as idioms.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It does not refer to a literal physical position behind a group of people. The "multitude" (רַבִּים) here refers to a group whose actions or opinions are being followed. This is a common way to express allegiance or conformity in Hebrew.

It is not a metaphor, simile, personification, or other figurative device.\n\n3.  **"וְלֹא־תַעֲנֶ֣ה עַל־רִ֗ב" (and you shall not answer/testify in a dispute)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "תַעֲנֶ֣ה עַל־רִ֗ב" (answer/testify in a dispute) could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is standard legal terminology.

It means to be swayed by, to lean towards, or to follow the influence of a group, leading to a deviation from justice. It does not imply a literal physical inclination behind a group.

However, "poor person" here directly refers to an individual of low economic status, which is a literal description. There is no indication that it stands in for something else or is used in a non-literal sense.\n2.  **לֹ֥א תֶהְדַּ֖ר (lōʾ teh-dar) - "you shall not show deference/partiality":** I considered if the verb הדר (hadar), meaning "to honor, glorify, show partiality," might be used figuratively. In a legal context, "to show deference" or "to be partial" is a direct and literal description of an action or attitude in judgment. It is not a cross-domain comparison (metaphor), a comparison using "like" or "as" (simile), or an attribution of human qualities to an inanimate object (personification). It is also not a fixed biblical idiom or set phrase like those provided in the examples (e.g., "mouth of the sword"). The meaning is straightforward: do not treat a poor person with special favor or partiality in a legal dispute.\n3.  **בְּרִיבֽוֹ (bə-rî-ḇō) - "in his dispute":** I considered if "dispute" could be a metaphor for a broader conflict or a metonymy for the legal process itself. However, "dispute" (רִיב) literally refers to a quarrel, contention, or legal case. Its use here is direct and literal, referring to the context in which partiality should not be shown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire verse employs standard, literal language to convey a legal/ethical instruction. There are no clear metaphors, similes, personifications, hyperboles, metonymies, or biblical idioms present. The language is direct and descriptive of actions and social roles.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the verb פג"ע (paga\') literally means "to meet," "to encounter," or "to happen upon." In this context, it describes the literal act of coming across an animal. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning implied. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"שׁ֧וֹר אֹֽיִבְךָ֛ א֥וֹ חֲמֹר֖וֹ" (your enemy’s ox or his ass):** I considered if "ox or ass" could be a metonymy or synecdoche for "property" in general, or perhaps for any valuable possession. However, the text specifically names these two common draft and pack animals, which were indeed significant forms of property in the ancient world. The instruction is precise about these particular animals. While they represent property, the reference is direct and literal to the animals themselves, not a stand-in for a broader concept in a figurative sense. Therefore, it is not metonymy.\n\n3.  **"תֹּעֶ֑ה" (wandering):** I considered if "wandering" could be personification, implying the animal has a will or intention to stray, or a metaphor for being spiritually lost. However, "wandering" (תעה, ta\'ah) is a literal and common descriptor for an animal that has strayed from its owner or its usual path. It accurately describes the physical state of the ox or ass. There is no attribution of human qualities or a cross-domain comparison to a spiritual state. Therefore, it is not personification or metaphor.\n\n4.  **"הָשֵׁ֥ב תְּשִׁיבֶ֖נּוּ לֽוֹ" (you must take it back / return, you shall return it to him):** I considered if the infinitive absolute construction "הָשֵׁ֥ב תְּשִׁיבֶ֖נּוּ" (hashev teshivenno) could be classified as hyperbole or an idiom. This construction is a common grammatical feature in Biblical Hebrew used to emphasize the verb, meaning "you shall surely return it" or "you must certainly return it." While it adds rhetorical force and urgency to the command, it does not exaggerate the action beyond its literal possibility or meaning. It is a strong, emphatic command, but it remains a literal instruction to return the animal. It does not fit the definition of hyperbole (exaggeration for effect, not meant literally) nor is it a fixed, non-literal idiom like those provided in the examples (e.g., "mouth of the sword"). It is standard narrative language for emphasis.

However, the text clearly and literally refers to the animal itself, which is the direct subject of the subsequent action. There is no indication that the animal stands for anything other than itself. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n2.  **"רֹבֵץ֙ תַּ֣חַת מַשָּׂא֔וֹ" (lying under its burden):** I considered if "burden" (מַשָּׂא) could be a metaphor for a general hardship or oppressive situation. However, in this context, the animal is physically "lying under" a literal load it is carrying. The phrase describes the literal physical state of the animal and its load. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n3.  **"וְחָדַלְתָּ֖ מֵעֲזֹ֣ב ל֑וֹ" (and would refrain from raising it):** I considered if "refrain from raising it" could imply a deeper moral or social reluctance beyond the physical act. However, the verb עָזַב (to leave, abandon, help) is used here in the specific, literal sense of assisting with the physical load, as clarified by the accompanying footnote. It describes a literal potential action (or inaction) related to the animal\'s physical predicament. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n4.  **"עָזֹ֥ב תַּעֲזֹ֖ב עִמּֽוֹ" (you must nevertheless help raise it):** I considered if the infinitive absolute construction (עָזֹ֥ב תַּעֲזֹ֖ב) constitutes hyperbole or a figurative idiom. This grammatical structure is used to emphasize the verb, conveying a strong command like "you must surely help" or "you must indeed help." While it adds intensity to the instruction, it does not alter the literal meaning of the action itself. It is a standard grammatical feature for emphasis in Hebrew, not a figure of speech that introduces a non-literal meaning or a cross-domain comparison (unlike, for example, "mouth of the sword"). Given the conservative guidelines, which distinguish between grammatical emphasis and figurative idioms, I am excluding this as figurative language.\n\nBased on a thorough review, I find no clear instances of metaphor, simile, personification, or figurative idioms in this verse according to the provided guidelines.

However, when this action is applied to an abstract concept like "מִשְׁפַּ֥ט" (justice or rights), it becomes metaphorical. One cannot physically "bend" or "turn aside" justice. Instead, the phrase conveys the idea of causing justice to deviate from its proper, straight, or equitable path, thereby corrupting or distorting it.

This is a classic example of metonymy, specifically synecdoche, where a part (the spoken word/statement) stands for the whole (the complete false accusation or legal case).

It is a standard expression for avoidance.\n3.  **"וְנָקִ֤י וְצַדִּיק֙ אַֽל־תַּהֲרֹ֔ג" (do not bring death on those who are innocent and in the right)**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "אַֽל־תַּהֲרֹ֔ג" (do not kill/bring death) could be a metaphor for destroying someone\'s reputation or livelihood.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** In the context of legal proceedings and false charges, "killing" (הרג) refers to literal execution or causing physical death, often as a result of an unjust verdict.

Here, "nefesh" (the inner being, soul, or self) stands in for the *inner experience*, *condition*, or *feelings* associated with that being, particularly the emotional and psychological state of being a stranger. One does not literally "know" a disembodied soul, but rather understands the person\'s state of being, their struggles, and their emotions. This usage is also a well-established biblical idiom for deep, empathetic understanding, often gained through shared experience. The English translation "feelings" accurately captures this figurative interpretation.\n    *   Borderline: It could be argued that "knowing the nefesh" is simply a literal way of expressing deep knowledge of a person. However, the context of the Israelites\' own past as strangers, and the emphasis on understanding the *experience* and *condition* of the stranger, strongly points to an empathetic understanding of their *inner state* or *feelings*. This specific aspect of the "nefesh" is highlighted through metonymy. Furthermore, as a common biblical idiom for empathetic understanding, it falls under the instruction to classify such phrases as "idiom."\n    *   Conclusion: Figurative (metonymy and idiom).\n\n3.  **כִּֽי־גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם** (having yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt)\n    *   Considered: Whether "גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם" (gerim heyitem, "you yourselves were strangers") or "בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם" (b\'eretz Mitzrayim, "in the land of Egypt") could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal historical statement recounting the Israelites\' past status as foreigners and their geographical location in Egypt.

The "foot" here serves as a metonymy, where the physical act of walking or journeying (by foot) stands for the entire pilgrimage occasion or festival. It\'s not a metaphor because it\'s not comparing "times" to "feet" in a direct likeness, but rather using "feet" as a conventional stand-in for the pilgrimage event itself.

It does not imply a literal viewing of God\'s facial features but rather an encounter with His presence or authority. This fits the instruction to classify biblical idioms and set phrases as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).\n\n7.  **רֵיקָֽם** (empty-handed)\n    *   **Considered**: If "empty-handed" is a literal description of hands or an idiom/metonymy for not bringing an offering.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While one\'s hands might literally be empty, in the context of appearing before a deity or superior, "empty-handed" is a common idiom meaning "without a gift or offering." It functions as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche) where the state of the hands (empty) represents the absence of the expected contents (an offering).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Marked as figurative (idiom, metonymy).', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in this agricultural context, "first fruits" (בִּכּוּרֵי) literally refers to the initial produce of the harvest, and "your work" (מַעֲשֶׂיךָ) refers to the labor that produced it. The phrase describes the actual first produce resulting from one\'s agricultural efforts. It is a literal description of the offering\'s origin.

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n4.  **"וְחַ֤ג הָֽאָסִף֙" (and the Feast of Ingathering):** Similar to "Feast of the Harvest," this is the literal, established name for another specific agricultural festival. It directly refers to the celebration associated with the ingathering of crops. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n5.  **"בְּצֵ֣את הַשָּׁנָ֔ה" (at the end of the year, lit. \'at the going out of the year\'):** I considered if this phrase constituted personification or an idiom. The verb "to go out" (יָצָא) is typically associated with animate beings or objects moving from a place. Applying it to an abstract concept like "the year" (הַשָּׁנָה) suggests a subtle personification, as if the year is a living entity departing. However, this expression is a very common and established idiomatic way in Hebrew to denote "the end of the year" or "the year\'s completion." As per instructions, biblical idioms are to be classified as "idiom" type. The figurative nature lies in the year not literally "going out," but the phrase functions as a fixed expression. I classify it primarily as an idiom.\n6.  **"בְּאׇסְפְּךָ֥ אֶֽת־מַעֲשֶׂ֖יךָ מִן־הַשָּׂדֶֽה" (when you gather in the results of your work from the field, lit. \'when you gather your work from the field\'):** I considered this phrase for metonymy. One does not literally "gather" abstract "work" (מַעֲשֶׂיךָ), but rather the tangible *products* or *results* of that work, i.e., the harvested crops. Here, "work" stands in for its concrete outcome. This is a clear instance of metonymy, where the activity (work) is used to refer to its product.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the overwhelming idiomatic usage of "אֶל־פְּנֵי" in Hebrew to mean "before" or "in the presence of" (without implying a literal visual encounter with a face) led to its classification as an idiom.

Crucially, in the context of sacrificial law (e.g., Exodus 23:18, Exodus 34:25, Leviticus 7:15), this exact phrase or similar constructions are standard, literal instructions regarding the disposition of sacrificial elements. It is a technical term within the ritual context, meaning the fat should not *remain* in its current state or location overnight. It does not attribute human-like qualities or actions to the fat itself, but rather describes its temporal state. Therefore, it is not personification. It is also not an idiom in the sense of having a meaning not deducible from its words, as "fat shall not remain overnight" is a direct interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:** After careful consideration of each element against the provided definitions and exclusions, I find no instances of figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, hyperbole, metonymy) in this verse.

This is a direct command meaning "do not rebel against him" or "do not provoke him." I found no figurative language here, as it is a straightforward prohibition.\n\n4.  **כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יִשָּׂא֙ לְפִשְׁעֲכֶ֔ם** (for he will not pardon your offenses / for he will not lift up for your transgression): I considered if "לֹא יִשָּׂא" (will not lift up/bear) was literal or figurative. In this context, "to lift up/bear transgression" is a well-established biblical idiom for "to pardon" or "to forgive" transgression. Therefore, "he will not lift up your transgression" is an idiom meaning "he will not pardon your offenses."\n\n5.  **כִּ֥י שְׁמִ֖י בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ** (since My Name is in him / for My Name is in his midst): I considered if "שְׁמִ֖י" (My Name) was a literal reference to the letters of God\'s name or a figurative representation of God\'s essence, presence, or authority. In biblical usage, "God\'s Name" frequently functions as a metonymy for God Himself, His authority, His character, or His active presence. The phrase "in him" (בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ - in his midst) further emphasizes this indwelling of divine authority. Thus, I classified "My Name" as a metonymy for God\'s presence and authority.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 4, 'instances_recovered': 4, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While "voice" (קֹל) could be considered metonymy for "command" or "word," the entire construction functions as a conventional, set phrase for expressing obedience. According to the guidelines, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase fits that description perfectly as a standard linguistic unit for expressing compliance, rather than a novel cross-domain comparison.\n    *   **Borderline Cases:** It could be argued that "voice" is a metonymy for the speaker\'s command or authority. However, the emphasis on the *act* of hearing and the subsequent obedience, as a complete expression, leans more strongly towards classifying it as an idiom, which is a broader category for conventional figurative expressions. The guidelines specifically list "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as a type to mark, which this clearly is.\n\n2.  **וְעָשִׂ֕יתָ כֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲדַבֵּ֑ר / and do all that I say:**\n    *   **Considered:** Literal statement.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward and literal command to perform actions based on divine instruction.

God declaring "I will be an enemy" describes His role and action in relation to Israel\'s adversaries. It is not a reference to a physical body part, nor is it a metaphorical comparison of God to something else. Therefore, this is interpreted as a literal statement of God\'s intended action and stance.\n\n4.  **וְצַרְתִּ֖י אֶת־צֹרְרֶֽיךָ / and a foe to your foes:**\n    *   **Considered:** Anthropomorphism, literal.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the previous phrase, God acting as a "foe" (from the verb צרר, "to be hostile to, to vex") describes His active opposition to Israel\'s enemies. This is a literal statement of divine action and role, consistent with the guidelines for interpreting divine anthropomorphisms in the ANE context.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phrase "שָׁמ֤וֹעַ תִּשְׁמַע֙ בְּקֹל֔וֹ" is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In this context, it refers to a concrete agent, whether a divine angel or a human leader (like Moses or Joshua), who performs the actions described. There is no cross-domain comparison or substitution of an abstract concept for a concrete one. It is a literal designation of an entity with a specific role.\n\n2.  **"goes before you" (יֵלֵ֣ךְ לְפָנֶ֒יךָ֒)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If this phrase could be an idiom for guidance or protection, or a metaphor for divine presence.\n    *   **Reasoning**: While "going before" inherently implies leadership, guidance, and potentially protection, the phrase itself describes a literal physical action of preceding someone in space. It is standard narrative language for leading or pioneering. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison (e.g., likening the messenger to a "pillar of fire" for guidance). The messenger literally walks ahead of the people. This is a literal description of a spatial relationship and a functional role, not a figurative expression.\n\n3.  **"and brings you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites" (וֶהֱבִֽיאֲךָ֗ אֶל־הָֽאֱמֹרִי֙ וְהַ֣חִתִּ֔י וְהַפְּרִזִּי֙ וְהַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י הַחִוִּ֖י וְהַיְבוּסִ֑י)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If the list of peoples could be a synecdoche for all inhabitants of the land, or if "brings you to" could be a metaphor for encountering challenges.\n    *   **Reasoning**: The list of peoples is a literal enumeration of specific ethnic groups inhabiting Canaan, frequently mentioned in biblical texts. It is a common convention to list these groups, and it functions as a literal, though perhaps not exhaustive, identification of the primary inhabitants to be encountered. "Brings you to" is a literal description of the messenger\'s action of leading the Israelites into the territory occupied by these groups. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended for either the action or the named groups.\n\n4.  **"and I annihilate them" (וְהִכְחַדְתִּֽיו)**:\n    *   **Considered**: If "annihilate" could be hyperbole, implying severe defeat rather than complete destruction, or a metaphor for a less direct form of removal.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a direct statement of divine action. In the Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context, divine actions, even those of extreme destruction, are generally understood literally unless they refer to God\'s body in a clearly metaphorical way (e.g., "God\'s arm"). The Hebrew verb כחד (kakhad) means to destroy, cut off, or annihilate. It describes a literal, albeit powerful and decisive, action God will perform. It is not hyperbole, as the biblical narrative often describes literal annihilation or expulsion of peoples as a consequence of divine judgment or covenant fulfillment.\n\nBased on this thorough analysis, I find no instances of clear metaphors, personification, obvious similes, or biblical idioms with non-literal meanings in this verse.

However, bowing is a literal physical act of prostration that is a direct and integral component of ancient worship. The English translation "in worship" clarifies the context but does not render the act of bowing itself figurative. Therefore, it is a literal command for a physical action with religious significance.\n\n2.  **וְלֹ֣א תׇֽעׇבְדֵ֔ם** (or follow their practices / or serve them): I considered if "serve them" (עבד) could be a metaphor for adhering to their religious system or practices. While "serve" in this context implies religious devotion and obedience, it is a direct and literal description of the relationship between a worshiper and a deity in the ancient Near East. It does not involve a cross-domain comparison.\n\n3.  **וְלֹ֥א תַעֲשֶׂ֖ה כְּמַֽעֲשֵׂיהֶ֑ם** (and not do according to their practices / or follow their practices): I considered if "do according to their practices" (תעשה כמעשיהם) contained a figurative comparison. The "כְּ" (like/according to) indicates a comparison of behavior. However, the guidelines explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: ... Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This phrase falls under a behavioral comparison, instructing not to act in a manner similar to the foreign peoples. Therefore, it is a literal statement of behavioral equivalence.\n\n4.  **כִּ֤י הָרֵס֙ תְּהָ֣רְסֵ֔ם** (but shall tear them down / for destroy you shall destroy them): I considered if "tear them down" (הרס תהרסם) could be a metaphor for dismantling their religious system in a non-physical sense. However, the subsequent clause specifies the object of destruction as "their pillars" (מצבותיהם), which are physical objects. Thus, "tear them down" refers to the literal physical destruction of cultic objects or places. The infinitive absolute construction (הרס תהרסם) emphasizes the completeness of the destruction but is a grammatical device for intensification, not a figurative one.\n\n5.  **וְשַׁבֵּ֥ר תְּשַׁבֵּ֖ר מַצֵּבֹתֵיהֶֽם** (and smash their pillars to bits / and break you shall break their pillars): I considered if "smash their pillars to bits" (שבר תשבר מצבותיהם) constituted hyperbole, implying an exaggerated degree of destruction. While the command emphasizes thorough destruction (again, using the infinitive absolute for intensification), it describes a literal and achievable physical action for stone pillars. It is not an exaggeration beyond what is literally intended or possible for such objects. Therefore, it is a literal command for physical destruction.\n\nBased on a conservative interpretation of the text and strict adherence to the provided guidelines, no figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, idiom, hyperbole, metonymy) was identified in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in the ANE context, "serving" a deity or a king is understood as a literal act of worship, obedience, and devotion, encompassing ritual, ethical, and social responsibilities. It is not a cross-domain comparison or a fixed phrase with a non-literal meaning, but rather a direct description of the expected relationship and actions. Therefore, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"who will bless your bread and your water" (וּבֵרַ֥ךְ אֶֽת־לַחְמְךָ֖ וְאֶת־מֵימֶ֑יךָ):** I considered if "bread and water" functions as a literal reference to specific food items or as a metonymy/synecdoche for general sustenance and provision. In biblical Hebrew, "bread and water" (לחם ומים) is a common merism, representing the full spectrum of food and drink, or more broadly, all basic necessities for life and sustenance. God blessing "your bread and your water" implies a blessing upon all your provisions, ensuring a plentiful supply of food and drink for the community. It is not just about two specific items but the entire category they represent. Therefore, I have included this as a metonymy (specifically, synecdoche where parts stand for the whole category of provision).\n\n3.  **"And I will remove sickness from your midst" (וַהֲסִרֹתִ֥י מַחֲלָ֖ה מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ):** I considered if "remove sickness" is figurative and if "from your midst" is a literal spatial description or a biblical idiom. "Remove sickness" is a literal action God performs. For "from your midst" (מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ), while "midst" (קרב) can literally refer to an inner part, when used in the context of a collective "you" (implied by the plural verb "you shall serve" earlier in the verse), "from your midst" functions as a well-established biblical idiom meaning "from among you" or "from within your community." It refers to the collective presence of the people rather than a literal internal organ. The instructions explicitly state to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, I have included "from your midst" as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It signifies that an individual will live out their full, divinely appointed lifespan, not dying prematurely. This is a conventional expression for a complete life, found in various biblical texts (e.g., Genesis 25:8, 35:29, Job 14:5, Psalm 90:10). While the verb "fill" (מלא) can have metaphorical uses, in this specific construction with "number of days," it functions as a fixed expression whose meaning is understood as "to live a full life." It is not a novel cross-domain comparison but a standard way of expressing this concept, thus fitting the definition of a biblical idiom.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** Whether the verb "fill" (אֲמַלֵּֽא) could be interpreted as a subtle metaphor for bringing something to completion, with "days" implicitly being a measure or container. However, given the instruction to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type, and the widespread use of this exact phrase, its idiomatic nature takes precedence over a purely metaphorical interpretation of the verb in isolation.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The application of the verb "send" to an abstract concept gives it agency and the ability to be dispatched, which is a clear instance of personification.

I settled on personification because the act of "sending" directly attributes a human-like action to an abstract entity.\n\n2.  **וְהַמֹּתִי֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר תָּבֹ֖א בָּהֶ֑ם** (and I will throw into panic all the people among whom you come)\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "throw into panic" (וְהַמֹּתִי֙) is figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion:** The verb הָמַם (hamam) means "to throw into confusion, discomfit, rout, or panic." This describes a direct action by God to affect the psychological state of the people. In the ANE context, divine actions that cause psychological or physical effects (like God causing panic or striking with disease) are generally understood as literal manifestations of divine power, not as figurative language, unless they refer to God\'s body. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification of an inanimate object, or obvious simile present here.\n\n3.  **וְנָתַתִּ֧י אֶת־כׇּל־אֹיְבֶ֛יךָ אֵלֶ֖יךָ עֹֽרֶף** (and I will make all your enemies turn tail before you / Lit. "back")\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if "turn tail" / "give the back" (נָתַתִּ֧י... עֹֽרֶף) is a literal action, metaphor, or idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The Hebrew phrase נָתַן עֹרֶף (natan oref, literally "to give the back/neck") is a well-established biblical idiom that signifies turning one\'s back in flight, i.e., fleeing or retreating in defeat. It is not a literal physical act of "giving" one\'s neck, but a conventionalized expression for a specific outcome. This falls directly under the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** None; this is a clear idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, "sending" is a direct, literal action that God performs in the narrative. This is standard narrative language for divine action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"אֶת־הַצִּרְעָ֖ה" (the ṣir‘ah / plague/hornet):** I considered if this term refers to a literal insect (hornet) or a literal disease/pestilence (plague), or if it is used figuratively. While "hornet" is a possible literal translation, and "plague" is another suggested meaning, the effect attributed to the *ṣir‘ah* in this verse and parallel passages (Deut 7:20, Josh 24:12) is to "drive out" entire nations. A literal swarm of hornets, while irritating, is unlikely to cause the complete expulsion of multiple nations from their land. Similarly, a literal disease, while it can decimate populations, does not typically "drive out" survivors in the sense of causing them to flee their territory en masse. Joshua 24:12 explicitly states that the *ṣir‘ah* drove out the Amorite kings "not by your sword or by your bow," strongly indicating a non-military, non-physical means of expulsion. This suggests that *ṣir‘ah* functions as a metaphor for a debilitating, fear-inducing divine force or psychological terror that causes the enemies to abandon their land and flee. It is a cross-domain comparison where a small, irritating, and potentially dangerous creature (hornet) or a debilitating affliction (plague) represents a powerful, terrifying, and expelling divine intervention.\n\n3.  **"לְפָנֶ֑יךָ" (ahead of you / before you):** I considered if this spatial phrase is an idiom. This is a common Hebrew prepositional phrase indicating spatial precedence ("in front of you") or temporal precedence ("ahead of you" in time/sequence). While it conveys a sense of "in advance," its meaning is direct and transparent, describing a literal spatial or sequential relationship. It does not carry a non-literal, culturally specific meaning that would classify it as an idiom in the figurative sense. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **"וְגֵרְשָׁ֗ה" (and it shall drive out):** I considered if the action of "driving out" is figurative. This verb describes a literal action of expulsion or causing to flee. When applied to nations, it refers to their physical removal from the land. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"אֶת־הַחִוִּ֧י אֶת־הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֛י וְאֶת־הַחִתִּ֖י" (the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites):** These are literal names of specific ethnic groups or nations. Therefore, they are not figurative.\n\n6.  **"מִלְּפָנֶֽיךָ" (from before you):** Similar to "לְפָנֶ֑יךָ", this is a literal spatial prepositional phrase indicating removal from one\'s presence or territory. It is not an idiom or other form of figurative language. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n2.  **"מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ" (before you / from your face):** I considered this phrase carefully. While literally meaning "from your face," this is a very common and established Hebrew idiom used to denote "from your presence" or "before you." It employs a part of the body (face) to represent the entire person\'s presence or immediate sphere of influence. This is a form of metonymy (specifically synecdoche), but as per the instructions, biblical idioms and set phrases are to be classified as "idiom." Since it is a clear set phrase with a non-literal meaning of its constituent parts, it is marked as figurative (idiom and metonymy).\n\n3.  **"בְּשָׁנָ֣ה אֶחָ֑ת" (in a single year):** This refers to a literal period of time.

Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **"וְרַבָּ֥ה עָלֶ֖יךָ חַיַּ֥ת הַשָּׂדֶֽה" (and the wild beasts multiply to your hurt):** I considered if "multiply to your hurt" could be figurative. "Multiply" is a literal biological process. "To your hurt" (עָלֶ֖יךָ, literally "upon you" in a negative sense) describes a literal negative consequence for the addressee. "Wild beasts" are literal animals. There is no personification of the animals beyond their natural actions, nor any other clear figurative device. Therefore, it is not marked as figurative.\n\nThe only phrase identified as figurative is "מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ" due to its idiomatic nature.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"from your face") is a very common biblical idiom meaning "from before you" or "from your presence." The "face" (פָּנֶה) in such contexts does not refer to the literal physical face but stands for the person\'s presence or immediate vicinity. The instruction explicitly states that "biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This fits that criterion perfectly.

In the context of a promise of land possession, it refers to the literal increase in population, which is a prerequisite for occupying and possessing a large territory. It is a literal description of demographic growth.

However, these are specific, literal geographical names and descriptions used to define the extent of the promised land. They function as precise boundaries, not as figurative representations. Therefore, they are not figurative.\n\n3.  **"אֶתֵּ֣ן בְּיֶדְכֶ֗ם" (I will deliver into your hands / I will give into your hands):** I considered if "into your hands" is a literal description of physical transfer. I concluded that this is a common biblical idiom. The phrase "נתן ביד" (natan b\'yad) meaning "to give into the hand(s) of" or "to deliver into the hand(s) of" is a well-established idiom signifying the granting of control, power, authority, or victory over someone or something, rather than a literal physical placement of people into someone\'s hands. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n\n4.  **"אֵ֚ת יֹשְׁבֵ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ" (the inhabitants of the land):** I considered if "inhabitants of the land" could be a synecdoche for the land itself or its resources. However, it is a direct and literal reference to the people residing in the territory. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **"וְגֵרַשְׁתָּ֖מוֹ מִפָּנֶֽיךָ" (and you will drive them out before you / from your face):** I considered if "מִפָּנֶֽיךָ" (mippaneykha, lit. "from your face") is a literal reference to the physical face. I concluded that this is a common Hebrew idiom. "מִפָּנֶיךָ" is an idiom meaning "from your presence," "before you," or "away from you/your territory." It does not refer to the physical face but rather to the sphere of influence or presence of the Israelites.

This usage reflects an ancient Near Eastern practice where covenants were often ratified through a ritual involving the cutting of animals, with the parties passing between the severed pieces (e.g., Genesis 15). While the literal act of cutting was part of the ritual, the phrase itself has become a fixed expression to denote the *making* of a covenant, regardless of whether the cutting ritual is explicitly performed or implied in every instance.

While the biblical worldview considers these "gods" to be non-existent or demonic, the text presents them as the literal objects of worship for those nations. There is no figurative comparison or substitution intended here; it is a direct reference to the entities they serve.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\nBased on this deliberation, only the phrase "to cut a covenant" is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n*   **"עֲלֵ֣ה" (Come up):** I considered if "come up" might be a metaphor for spiritual ascent, increased status, or a non-physical elevation. However, in the context of the command to ascend Mount Sinai, "come up" refers to a literal physical action of moving upwards on the mountain. It is a direct, literal instruction.\n\n*   **"אֶל־יְהֹוָ֗ה" (to יהוה):** I considered if "to יהוה" could be metonymy for God\'s presence or a specific manifestation, or if it implied a non-physical approach. The instructions state that divine anthropomorphisms (e.g., God went, God was angry) are to be treated as LITERAL in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body. Here, "come up to יהוה" refers to approaching the localized manifestation of God\'s presence on Mount Sinai, not God\'s physical body.

However, "bowing low" (הִשְׁתַּחֲוָה) is a well-attested physical act of prostration or obeisance in the ancient Near East, signifying worship or respect. It describes a literal physical action.\n\n*   **"מֵרָחֹֽק" (from afar):** I considered if "from afar" could be a metaphor for spiritual distance or a lack of intimacy.

While a literal interpretation is acoustically possible, the common usage of "one voice" (קוֹל אֶחָד) in biblical Hebrew, as in English, typically conveys a unified message or complete consensus among a group, rather than a precise acoustic phenomenon. This fits the instruction to classify "biblical idioms and set phrases" as "idiom" type. It is a conventionalized expression to denote agreement.

However, "commands" (דִּבְרֵי) literally refers to spoken or written words or instructions. Moses literally performed the action of writing them down. This is standard narrative language describing a direct action and its object. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וַיַּשְׁכֵּ֣ם בַּבֹּ֔קֶר** (Early in the morning): This is a literal temporal description indicating the time of day.

However, the Hebrew word תַּחַת (tachat) means "under" or "at the base of," and does not employ a body part like "foot" (רֶגֶל) to describe the mountain. It is a literal spatial descriptor indicating the location at the base of the mountain. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **וּשְׁתֵּ֤ים עֶשְׂרֵה֙ מַצֵּבָ֔ה לִשְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָׂ֖ר שִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל** (with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel): I considered if the "twelve pillars" (מַצֵּבָה) standing "for" (לִשְׁנֵים) the "twelve tribes of Israel" (שִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל) constitutes metonymy or synecdoche. My reasoning for including it as figurative is that the pillars are not merely dedicated *to* the tribes in a functional sense, but rather they *represent* or *symbolize* each tribe. Each physical pillar stands in place of or embodies the identity of one of the twelve tribal groups. This is a clear instance where a concrete object (pillar) stands for an abstract entity or group (tribe), making it a form of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a related object represents the whole group).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, in this context, it describes a direct, literal action of appointing or dispatching individuals for a specific task.

No figurative language is present.\n2.  **"חֲצִ֣י הַדָּ֔ם" (one part of the blood / half of the blood)**: This is a literal description of a quantity of a physical substance. I considered if "blood" itself might be a metonymy for life or covenant. However, in the context of a ritual described in Exodus 24, the blood is a literal, physical component of the covenant ceremony. While it *symbolizes* the covenant and life, its presence and handling are literal actions with a literal substance.

My reasoning, based on the provided guidelines, is that divine anthropomorphisms (like God speaking, going, or being angry) are considered literal in the ANE context unless they refer to specific physical body parts of God (e.g., "God\'s finger").

The act of "seeing God" is presented as a direct narrative event. While the *nature* of this seeing might be profound, the narrative itself treats it as a direct observation.

"Feet" is a body part. Therefore, this reference to God\'s feet is interpreted as figurative, specifically metonymy (or synecdoche, a type of metonymy). It represents the foundation or base of God\'s manifested presence or authority, rather than literal human-like feet. This is a borderline case in the sense that anthropomorphisms are generally literal, but the specific instruction regarding God\'s body parts overrides that for figurative interpretation.

Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֖ח יָד֑וֹ" (did not raise a hand / did not send his hand):** I considered if this phrase was a literal description of a physical action (not extending a hand) or a figurative expression. I determined it is a well-established biblical idiom. The phrase "שלח יד" (šālaḥ yād) consistently means "to lay hands on," "to harm," or "to attack" in Biblical Hebrew, rather than a literal sending or raising of a physical hand.

While the cloud itself carries immense theological significance in the Sinai narrative (representing God\'s presence, glory, or concealment), the *action* of "covering" is not a cross-domain comparison. The cloud literally performs the action of covering. The text describes what physically occurred, not a metaphorical representation of that occurrence.

The "glory" or "presence" of Yahweh refers to a manifestation or self-revelation of God, not a physical body part.

This is a direct and obvious comparison, fitting the definition of a simile. The phrase "אֵ֥שׁ אֹכֶ֖לֶת" (consuming fire) describes the nature of the fire itself, which is then used as the vehicle for the comparison. This clearly falls under the instruction to "MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Obvious similes."\n\n3.  **בְּרֹ֣אשׁ הָהָ֑ר (on the top of the mountain):**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if this phrase could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward, literal geographical description of the location where the divine manifestation occurred.

I concluded it is literal and not figurative.\n\n2.  **וְיִקְחוּ־לִ֖י תְּרוּמָ֑ה** (to bring Me gifts): I considered if "Me" referring to God or "gifts" could be figurative.

It does not; the physical heart does not literally "move" or "make willing" in the sense of volition.\n    *   **Personification:** I considered if this is personification. Yes, the "heart" (לב), a non-human entity in this context (distinct from the full conscious person), is attributed the action of "moving" or "making willing" (יִדְּבֶנּוּ), which is a volitional act typically associated with a conscious agent or the entire person.

Yes, "לב" (heart) is commonly used in biblical Hebrew as a metonymy for the inner self, the seat of intellect, will, and emotion, representing the individual\'s inner disposition, conscience, or free will. Here, the part (heart) stands for an aspect of the whole (the person\'s inner willingness).\n    *   **Idiom:** I considered if this is an idiom. Yes, "whose heart moves him" or "whose heart makes him willing" is a well-established biblical idiom (e.g., Exodus 35:21, 29; 36:2; 1 Chronicles 29:9) signifying inner willingness, spontaneity, or free will.

I decided to mark all applicable types (personification, metonymy, idiom) as the JSON structure allows for multiple classifications, and the guidelines specifically instruct to mark personification and idioms. The "idiom" classification is particularly important given the explicit instruction.\n\n---', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

In this context, it directly denotes the items being given. It is not standing in for an abstract concept or an action in a figurative sense, but rather naming the objects of the collection. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n2.  **"אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּקְח֖וּ מֵאִתָּ֑ם" (that you shall accept from them)**:\n    *   Considered if the verb "accept" (תִּקְח֖וּ, from לָקַח) could be an idiom or a metaphor for something beyond simple reception, such as a formal appropriation or a symbolic act.\n    *   Reasoning: The verb לָקַח means "to take, to receive, to accept."

The verb צָפָה (tsapah) means "to overlay" or "to plate," and זָהָב טָהוֹר (zahav tahor) refers to a specific material, "pure gold."

The instruction is to cover both the interior and exterior dimensions of the object with gold. It is a precise spatial description of the extent of the physical overlaying, not a figurative expression for comprehensive knowledge, spiritual transformation, or any abstract concept. The ANE context for such building/crafting instructions typically employs precise, literal language to ensure accurate construction.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** This was the closest to a potential idiom, but the immediate context of physical construction strongly supports a literal interpretation of spatial coverage.

"Feet" (פַּעַם) are typically biological body parts of humans or animals. Attributing "feet" to a piece of furniture or a cultic object is a common way to describe its base, supports, or corners upon which it rests. This is a clear instance of personification, as a non-human, inanimate entity is given a human/animal body part. It is not a literal biological foot, but the part of the object that serves a similar function (i.e., supporting it, resting on the ground).

However, צֶלַע has a well-established and direct meaning of "side" or "flank" when referring to inanimate objects or structures in biblical Hebrew (e.g., the sides of the ark, the sides of the tabernacle). This is a standard descriptive term for a part of an object, not a cross-domain comparison, metaphor, or personification. Therefore, I am excluding it as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

While "ribs" is a body part, in biblical Hebrew, צֶלַע (tsela\') is commonly and literally used to refer to the "side" or "flank" of inanimate objects, especially architectural structures like the Tabernacle, altars, or the Ark itself. It functions as a conventional architectural term for the lateral surfaces. For example, Exodus 26:20 uses צֶלַע for the "side" of the tabernacle. This usage is analogous to English terms like "the arm of a chair" or "the leg of a table," which are conventional and literal descriptions rather than literary personification. Given the conservative guidelines for interpreting such terms, particularly in ANE contexts where anthropomorphic language for God is often considered literal unless referring to a specific body part, I determined that "צַלְעֹ֣ת הָאָרֹ֑ן" is a literal, conventional description of the ark\'s side walls, not a figurative one.\n\n3.  **"לָשֵׂ֥את אֶת־הָאָרֹ֖ן בָּהֶֽם" (for carrying the ark):** I considered if this phrase contained any figurative elements.

It refers to the content of the covenant, the divine stipulations that serve as a witness to God\'s relationship with Israel. However, the instruction is to "deposit *the testimony* in the Ark." One does not physically deposit an abstract concept like "testimony" or "pact" into a box. Instead, one deposits the physical objects *containing* that testimony—the stone tablets.

Cherubim are not literally human "brothers." However, this phrase is a very common and established idiom in Biblical Hebrew used to express reciprocity or mutual orientation between two or more entities, meaning "each other" or "one another." While it uses terms associated with human relationships ("man," "brother"), its primary function here is grammatical/idiomatic to denote a reciprocal relationship, not to imbue the cherubim with human familial qualities.

The term "Ark" (אֲר֣וֹן) refers to a literal physical object. However, "Testimony" or "Pact" (הָעֵדֻ֑ת) refers to the tablets of the law contained within the Ark, which serve as a witness to the covenant. Naming the Ark by its most significant content or purpose (the testimony/covenant) is a form of metonymy, where a container is named by its contents or an object by its function. This is also a well-established biblical idiom or set phrase for this specific sacred object. According to the instructions, biblical idioms that are figurative should be classified as "idiom" type. Therefore, this phrase is figurative as both an idiom and a metonymy.\n\n5.  **אֵ֣ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֧ר אֲצַוֶּ֛ה אוֹתְךָ֖ אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל** ("all that I will command you concerning the Israelite people"): I considered if "command you" or "Israelite people" might be figurative. "Command" is a literal action of giving instructions. "Israelite people" (בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל, lit. "sons of Israel") is a standard collective term for the nation, not a figurative expression.

It functions as a standard term for a structural support, analogous to how English uses "table leg" or "arm of a chair."

However, they are described *as if* they are houses or dwelling places for the poles, providing a secure and designated enclosure for them. This is a clear cross-domain comparison where the rings (a created object) are identified with houses (another created object/dwelling) to describe their function. The Hebrew uses the preposition לְ (le-) meaning "for" or "as," directly applying the noun "houses" to the rings\' function. This is a direct identification rather than a comparison using כְּמוֹ (like/as), making it a metaphor. The English translation "as holders" interprets the function but loses the vivid metaphorical imagery of "houses." This is not a comparison of role or function in the sense of \'a prophet like myself\' (כָּמֹנִי), which the instructions state to exclude, because it\'s a direct metaphorical identification rather than a simple statement of functional equivalence using a comparative particle.\n    *   **Borderline cases/Debate:** One might argue it\'s simply a functional description, but the choice of "houses" (בָּתִּים) over a more generic term for "holder" or "receptacle" elevates it to a metaphorical level, imbuing the rings with the quality of providing a secure, designated "home" for the poles. The literal meaning of "house" is clearly not intended, thus it\'s a figurative use of the word.\n\n4.  **לָשֵׂ֖את אֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָֽן (to carry the table):** This phrase describes the literal purpose of the poles and rings. I considered if "carry" or "table" could be figurative, but they are used in their plain, literal sense here.

There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage.\n\n2.  **"לֶ֥חֶם פָּנִ֖ים" (bread of display / bread of presence):** I considered if this phrase might be a metaphor, metonymy, or an idiom.\n    *   **Metaphor/Metonymy:** The literal translation "bread of faces" (לֶחֶם פָּנִים) could suggest that "faces" (פָּנִים) is a metonymy for "presence" or "display." While "פָּנִים" often functions metonymically for presence in Hebrew, in this specific compound, the entire phrase "לֶחֶם פָּנִים" is a fixed, technical term.\n    *   **Idiom:** The instructions explicitly state: "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." "לֶחֶם פָּנִים" is a quintessential example of such a biblical idiom, referring to the specific ritual bread placed in the Tabernacle/Temple. It is not literally bread that *has* faces, but bread *for* the presence/display. Therefore, I classify the entire phrase as an idiom.\n\n3.  **"לְפָנַ֥י" (before Me / to My face):** I considered if this phrase was a divine anthropomorphism referring to God\'s body (His face) and thus figurative, or if it was an idiom.\n    *   **Divine Anthropomorphism:** The instructions state that divine anthropomorphisms are literal "unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." "Face" (פָּנִים) is a body part. Therefore, "to My face" could be interpreted as figurative if taken literally as a physical face.\n    *   **Idiom:** However, "לְפָנַי" is a very common and well-established biblical idiom meaning "in My presence" or "before Me." The instructions prioritize classifying biblical idioms as "idiom" type. The anthropomorphic element of "face" is subsumed into the idiomatic meaning of presence. This is a borderline case where an anthropomorphic term is used idiomatically. Given the strong directive to mark idioms, and the common understanding of "לְפָנַי" as "in my presence" rather than literally in front of a physical face, I classify it as an idiom.\n\n4.  **"תָּמִֽיד" (always):** I considered if this adverb contained any figurative language.

Concluded it is a literal description of the manufacturing method, specifying that the lampstand is to be formed from a single piece of metal by hammering, not a figurative representation of skill.\n*   **"יְרֵכָ֣הּ" (its base / lit. its thigh):** Considered this as a potential metaphor or personification. The Hebrew word יָרֵךְ (yarekh) primarily refers to a human or animal "thigh" or "loin." Applying this term to the base of an inanimate object like a lampstand is a clear cross-domain comparison. The lampstand does not literally possess a thigh. Therefore, it is a metaphor, likening the supporting base of the lampstand to the strong, foundational part of a body.\n*   **"וְקָנָ֔הּ" (and its shaft / lit. and its reed/stalk):** Considered this as a potential metaphor. The Hebrew word קָנֶה (qaneh) means "reed" or "stalk" of a plant, as well as a "shaft" or "pipe." While "shaft" can be a literal term for a lampstand\'s central pillar, in the context of other explicitly floral terms (cups, calyxes, petals) that follow, the primary sense of "reed" or "stalk" is strongly evoked. This creates a metaphor that likens the lampstand\'s central pillar to a plant\'s stalk, emphasizing an organic, growing form.\n*   **"גְּבִיעֶ֛יהָ" (its cups):** Considered if "cups" might be a metaphor for shape. While the parts are shaped *like* cups, "cup" (גָּבִיעַ) is a common and literal term for a vessel of that shape. It is a direct description of the form, not a cross-domain comparison in the same way as "thigh" or "flower." Therefore, it is excluded as figurative.\n*   **"כַּפְתֹּרֶ֥יהָ" (its calyxes / lit. its knobs/calyxes):** Considered this as a potential metaphor. The Hebrew word כַּפְתּוֹר (kaftor) can mean "knob" or "capital," but also "calyx" of a flower. Given the explicit mention of "flowers/petals" (פְּרָחֶיהָ) immediately following, the interpretation of "calyxes" (the part of a flower that encloses the petals) is strongly implied. This likens the decorative elements to parts of a flower, making it a metaphor for their shape and design.\n*   **"וּפְרָחֶ֖יהָ" (and its petals/flowers):** Considered this as a clear metaphor. The Hebrew word פֶּרַח (perach) means "flower" or "blossom." A lampstand does not literally have flowers or petals growing on it. Parts of it are designed to *resemble* flowers or petals. This is a direct cross-domain comparison for the decorative elements, making it a metaphor.\n*   **"מִמֶּ֥נָּה יִהְיֽוּ" (shall be of one piece / lit. from it they shall be):** Considered if this could be an idiom for unity or integrity. Concluded it is a literal instruction regarding the construction method, emphasizing that the parts are not attached but integral to the main piece, formed from the same material. Therefore, it is excluded as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 4, 'instances_recovered': 4, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The Hebrew participle describes the form of the cups by directly referencing almond blossoms. The cups are man-made objects, and their appearance is being likened to a natural object (almond blossoms). This is a clear comparison of visual form, not a literal identity. The English translation "shaped like almond-blossoms" explicitly renders this as a simile.

A calyx is botanically the outermost whorl of sepals of a flower. Here, it refers to a decorative element on a man-made lampstand.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: While the term is borrowed from the natural world, the menorah itself is explicitly designed to incorporate natural, botanical forms (e.g., almond blossoms, buds, flowers, branches). Therefore, referring to a specific decorative feature as a "calyx" is a literal description of its intended form and appearance within the context of the menorah\'s design. It is not a cross-domain comparison where the object *is* something else, but rather a direct naming of a component that *resembles* or *is designed to be* a calyx. This is akin to calling a part of a building a "wing" or a "foot" – these terms, though originating from other domains, become literal descriptors within the specific context of the object\'s design.\n\n2.  **הַקָּנִ֜ים (haqqanim) - "the branches"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if the term "branches" constitutes a metaphor. Branches are typically parts of a tree or plant. Here, they refer to the extensions of the metal lampstand.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: Similar to "calyx," the menorah\'s overall design is botanical. The extensions of the lampstand are literally shaped and function like branches of a plant, holding lights. Therefore, calling them "branches" is a literal description of their form and function within the context of the menorah\'s design, which is intended to mimic natural forms. It is not a figurative comparison but a direct naming of a component based on its appearance and role.\n\n3.  **הַיֹּצְאִ֖ים מִן־הַמְּנֹרָֽה (hayyotz\'im min-hammenorah) - "issuing from the lampstand"**:\n    *   **Considered**: I considered if the verb "issuing" (literally "going out" or "emerging") constitutes personification or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning for exclusion**: The verb יָצָא (yatza\') is a common and literal verb used to describe something extending, emerging, or coming forth from a source, whether animate or inanimate. Branches "issue" from a tree, water "issues" from a spring, and here, the metal branches physically "issue" or extend from the central shaft of the lampstand. This is a straightforward, literal description of their physical connection and origin point. There is no attribution of human qualities or a cross-domain comparison involved.\n\n**Conclusion**: The text is highly descriptive and technical, detailing the physical construction of the menorah. The language used (e.g., "calyx," "branches") directly reflects the naturalistic design of the object.

While it can extend to mean "surface" or "front" of an inanimate object (e.g., "face of the earth"), its application to an object like the lampstand (menorah) to denote its "front side" subtly imbues the object with a human-like characteristic of having a "face." This is a mild form of personification, as it attributes an anatomical feature typically associated with living beings to an inanimate object.\n    *   **Considered Metonymy/Synecdoche:** I considered if "face" was a part representing the whole "front side" in a metonymic sense. However, the primary figurative element is the attribution of a human feature to an object, rather than a part standing in for a whole in a non-literal way. The meaning "front side" is derived from the literal components, but the choice of "face" for an object is the figurative aspect.\n    *   **Considered Idiom:** I considered if "עֵ֥בֶר פָּנֶֽיהָ" was a fixed idiom. While "פָּנֶה" is used in many idiomatic expressions, in this context, the meaning "front side" is quite direct, but the *choice* of "face" for an inanimate object is what makes it figurative, not that the phrase as a whole has a non-literal meaning.\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The use of פָּנֶה ("face") to describe the front of an inanimate object (the lampstand) is a subtle personification. It gives the object a human-like orientation, as if it possesses a "face" that looks forward. The English translation "front side" captures the intended meaning but loses this subtle anthropomorphic nuance.

Instead, the phrase functions as a fixed expression to describe the reciprocal connection or joining of similar items. It\'s not a creative cross-domain comparison intended to evoke a specific image of human interaction for the cloths themselves.\n    *   **Reasoning for including as an idiom:** This is a well-established idiom in Biblical Hebrew (and similar constructions like אִישׁ אֶל אָחִיו "a man to his brother") used to express "one another" or "each to the other," particularly when describing the connection or proximity of multiple similar objects or entities. Examples include the cherubim facing "each other" (Exod 25:20), the wings of cherubim touching "one another" (Exod 26:3), and indeed, the curtains of the tabernacle being joined "one to another" (Exod 26:3, 5, 6, 17; 36:10, 12, 14, 17). Its consistent use across various contexts for inanimate objects confirms its idiomatic nature as a reciprocal pronoun or adverbial phrase, rather than a literal personification or metaphor. It\'s a conventional linguistic device for expressing mutuality.\n    *   **Borderline cases debated:** The primary debate was whether to classify it as personification due to the use of human relationship terms for inanimate objects, or as an idiom. Given the widespread and consistent use of this exact phrase (and its masculine counterpart) in technical descriptions of how objects connect, without any further development of human characteristics for those objects, the idiomatic classification is more accurate. It\'s a grammaticalized expression of reciprocity rather than a vivid figurative comparison.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"Sides of the tabernacle" refers to physical parts of the structure. "מִזֶּה וּמִזֶּה" (from this and from this / on this side and on that side) is a common, literal directional phrase, not an idiom with a non-literal meaning. Therefore, this is literal.\n*   **"לְכַסֹּתוֹ" (and cover it)**: I considered if "to cover" could be a metaphor for protection or concealment in a broader, abstract sense. However, in the context of constructing a tent or tabernacle, "covering" is a literal, functional action of the cloth over the structure. Its purpose is to physically enclose and protect the interior from elements, which is a direct and literal function. Therefore, this is literal.\n\nBased on a conservative analysis, the entire verse provides technical, architectural instructions for the Tabernacle\'s construction, using precise and literal language.

In this specific context, "tenon" is a technical, literal meaning for a structural component of a plank. It\'s not describing the tenon *as if* it were a hand, but rather using a specialized, established term for that part. This is semantic extension or polysemy, not figurative language in the sense of a cross-domain comparison or substitution. It is a literal description of a physical object.\n\n2.  **"מְשֻׁ֨לָּבֹ֔ת אִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל־אֲחֹתָ֑הּ" (parallel to each other / woman to her sister):**\n    *   **What I considered:** I considered if the phrase "אִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל־אֲחֹתָ֑הּ" (woman to her sister) was an idiom, a simile, or personification.\n    *   **Reasoning for including it:** This is a well-established Hebrew idiom meaning "one to another," "each other," or "matching/parallel." It uses terms from the human domain (woman, sister) to describe the relationship or arrangement of inanimate objects (the tenons). This constitutes both an idiom and a form of personification, as it attributes a human-like relationship (sisterhood) to non-human entities. The instruction explicitly states to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type. While it functions like a simile ("like a a woman to her sister"), its fixed nature makes "idiom" the primary classification, with "personification" also applicable due to the attribution of human relationship. The English translation "parallel to each other" interprets the *meaning* of the idiom in context, but the Hebrew itself is figurative.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** I debated whether to classify it primarily as a simile or an idiom. Given the instruction "classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type," and its common usage as a fixed phrase, "idiom" is the most appropriate primary classification. However, the underlying mechanism clearly involves personification (attributing a human relationship to inanimate objects).\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

For example, "hand" (יָד) is frequently used for a handle, a projection, a support, or a side. This is similar to how English uses "leg" for a table support or "arm" for a chair part. These are established technical or descriptive terms rather than novel or striking cross-domain comparisons intended for literary effect. The plank is not being personified as having human-like agency or characteristics; rather, a human body part is used to describe a functional projection due to a perceived similarity in form or function (e.g., a "hand" grasps or extends, similar to how a tenon projects to fit into a socket). Given the conservative guidelines, which emphasize marking "clear metaphors," "obvious similes," and "personification of non-human entities" while being conservative with "standard narrative language," this conventional usage does not meet the criteria for figurative language.

This is a semantic extension within a specific domain (architecture) that has become a literal, technical term, not a figurative comparison. It directly refers to a structural component of the Tabernacle.

"Sockets" (אֲדָנִים) are literal bases or pedestals, and "silver" (כֶּסֶף) is the literal material. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here.

While the word\'s etymology might relate to "rib," its use in architectural contexts (e.g., 1 Kings 6:5, 8; Ezekiel 41:5-9) is conventional and literal, referring to a "side" or "side chamber." It functions as a standard architectural term for a structural side, much like "leg" for a table leg.

However, in architectural contexts, it is consistently used to denote a "side," "side chamber," or "wall" of a structure (e.g., 1 Kings 6:5, 8; Ezekiel 41:5-11). I considered if this constitutes a metaphor (comparing a structural side to a human rib). However, given its consistent and conventional use as a technical architectural term in biblical Hebrew, it functions as a literal designation for a structural component rather than a fresh, vivid cross-domain comparison. It\'s an extended, specialized meaning that has become standard terminology, similar to how "mouth" can refer to an opening or "face" to a surface. The guidelines emphasize being conservative with standard narrative language and not marking comparisons of role or function. In this context, "צֶֽלַע" is the standard term for the side/wall of the Tabernacle.

However, the text explicitly refers to the physical object itself, not standing in for something else. This is a literal description of a specific component.\n\n2.  **"בְּת֣וֹךְ הַקְּרָשִׁ֑ים" (halfway up the planks / in the midst of the planks):** This phrase describes the spatial relationship of the bar to the planks. I considered if "in the midst of" could be an idiom or metaphor, but it is a straightforward, literal description of location.\n\n3.  **"מַבְרִ֕חַ" (shall run / extends):** This is the primary verb describing the action of the bar. The root ב.ר.ח (b.r.ḥ) primarily means "to flee" or "to run away" when referring to animate beings. However, in technical contexts, especially when describing structural elements like bars or bolts, it commonly means "to pass through," "to extend," or "to run" from one point to another (e.g., Exodus 26:28, 36:33). I considered if this usage constituted personification, as a bar does not literally "run" in the human sense. However, this is a standard, literal, and technical description of the bar\'s function and physical extension within the structure in biblical Hebrew. It does not attribute human-like will, emotion, or complex action to the bar, but rather describes its simple physical property of extending. English uses similar phrasing (e.g., "a pipe runs through the wall," "a wire runs from end to end"). Given the conservative nature of the analysis and the instruction to only mark "clear metaphors" and "obvious similes/personification," this usage falls within the bounds of standard, literal technical language for describing inanimate objects in this context, rather than a figurative attribution of human qualities.

However, "to hang" (נתן in this context, meaning to place or set, often used for hanging) is a direct, literal instruction for a physical action. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage here. It is a standard command for construction.\n2.  **"אַרְבָּעָה֙ עַמּוּדֵ֣י שִׁטִּ֔ים" (four posts of acacia wood):** I considered if "posts of acacia wood" could be a metonymy for strength or durability, or if "four" had symbolic, non-literal significance. However, this is a precise, literal description of the material and quantity of the structural elements. In a narrative text detailing construction, such descriptions are inherently literal.\n3.  **"מְצֻפִּ֣ים זָהָ֔ב" (overlaid with gold):** I considered if "gold" might be a metaphor for divine glory or purity. While gold often carries symbolic weight in biblical texts, in this specific context of describing the physical construction of the Tabernacle, "overlaid with gold" is a literal statement about the material composition of the posts. It describes a physical attribute, not a figurative one.\n4.  **"וָוֵיהֶ֖ם זָהָ֑ב" (and their hooks of gold / having hooks of gold):** Similar to the gold overlay, I considered if "hooks of gold" could be symbolic.

Again, this is a literal description of the bases (sockets) and their material (silver), along with their quantity. Silver, like gold, can have symbolic meaning, but in this prescriptive architectural context, it refers to the actual metal used.\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire verse is a straightforward, technical instruction detailing the materials and construction of a part of the Tabernacle.

However, this is a literal instruction for a physical action involving a tangible object. No figurative language is present here.\n2.  **"under the clasps" (תַּ֣חַת הַקְּרָסִים֒):** I considered if this spatial description was figurative. It describes a literal physical placement of the curtain in relation to the clasps. No figurative language.\n3.  **"carry there" (וְהֵבֵאתָ֥ שָׁ֙מָּה֙):** I considered if the verb "carry" was figurative. This is a literal instruction for a physical action. No figurative language.\n4.  **"behind the curtain" (מִבֵּ֣ית לַפָּרֹ֔כֶת):** I considered if this spatial description was figurative. It describes a literal physical placement of the Ark relative to the curtain. No figurative language.\n5.  **"the Ark of the Pact" (אֲר֣וֹן הָעֵד֑וּת):** I considered if this phrase was a literal description or a figurative idiom/metonymy. The "Ark" (אֲרוֹן) is a literal wooden chest. "Pact" or "Testimony" (הָעֵדוּת) refers to the tablets of the covenant contained within the Ark. Therefore, "Ark of the Pact/Testimony" is a metonymic idiom where the object (the Ark) is named by its primary contents or association (the Testimony/Pact). It is a standard, fixed designation for this sacred object in biblical Hebrew. The guidelines instruct to classify figurative idioms as "idiom" type. I will mark this as both metonymy and idiom.\n6.  **"so that the curtain shall serve you as a partition" (וְהִבְדִּילָ֤ה הַפָּרֹ֙כֶת֙ לָכֶ֔ם):** I considered if "serve as a partition" was figurative. The Hebrew verb הִבְדִּילָה means "it shall separate" or "it shall make a distinction." The curtain literally performs the function of separating the two areas. It *is* a partition, not merely *like* one. This is a literal description of its intended function, not a figurative comparison. No figurative language.\n7.  **"between the Holy" (בֵּ֣ין הַקֹּ֔דֶשׁ):** I considered if "the Holy" was a literal description or a figurative idiom/metonymy. "The Holy" (הַקֹּדֶשׁ) is an abstract quality (holiness). In this context, it refers to the specific physical area of the Tabernacle known as the Holy Place. This is a metonymy where an abstract quality stands for the place possessing that quality. It is a standard, fixed designation for this area, functioning as a biblical idiom. I will mark this as both metonymy and idiom.\n8.  **"and the Holy of Holies" (וּבֵ֖ין קֹ֥דֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִֽׁים):** I considered if "the Holy of Holies" was a literal description or a figurative idiom/metonymy. "Holy of Holies" (קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים, literally "holiness of holies" or "most holy thing") is an abstract quality used to designate the innermost, most sacred physical area of the Tabernacle. This is a metonymy where an abstract quality stands for the place possessing that quality. It is a standard, fixed designation for this area, functioning as a biblical idiom. I will mark this as both metonymy and idiom.\n\nBorderline cases: The primary debate centered on whether the fixed designations "Ark of the Pact," "the Holy," and "the Holy of Holies" should be considered figurative. While they are standard terms, they employ metonymy (naming by association or quality rather than direct description) to refer to their referents. The Ark is not literally "the pact," nor is the place literally "the holiness." Given the instruction to classify "figurative idioms" as "idiom" type, and metonymy being a form of figurative language, these phrases fit the criteria.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

I considered if its use to describe a "wall" or "side" of a building might be a metaphor (likening the Tabernacle to a body with ribs/sides) or metonymy. However, `צֶלַע` is a well-attested architectural term in biblical Hebrew, frequently used to denote the "side" or "wall" of a structure (e.g., Exodus 26:20, 1 Kings 6:5).

However, in the context of detailed architectural instructions, "make" (עָשָׂה) is a direct, literal command for physical fabrication. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended.\n\n2.  **עֲצֵ֣י שִׁטִּ֑ים** (of acacia wood): I considered if the specific material, acacia wood, might carry a symbolic or metonymic meaning beyond its literal identity as a type of timber.

They are not being used to describe an abstract concept or quality.\n\n4.  **רָב֤וּעַ יִהְיֶה֙ הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ** (the altar is to be square): I considered if "square" could be a metaphor for stability, perfection, or completeness. While a square shape might *connote* such qualities in some cultural contexts, in this instructional text, "square" (רָבוּעַ) is a literal geometric description of the altar\'s footprint. It is not a cross-domain comparison where the altar is *likened* to something square in a non-literal sense; it *is* square. Therefore, it is not a metaphor.\n\n5.  **וְשָׁלֹ֥שׁ אַמּ֖וֹת קֹמָתֽוֹ** (and three cubits high): Similar to the other dimensions, I considered if the height measurement could be symbolic. However, this is a literal, precise dimension for the altar\'s physical construction.\n\nIn conclusion, the entire verse consists of straightforward, literal instructions for the physical construction of the altar, detailing its material, dimensions, and shape.

However, in the context of altar construction in the ancient Near East, "horns" (קרנות) refer to literal, physical projections at the corners of the altar. These were architectural features with practical functions (e.g., for binding sacrifices, as a place of asylum). This is a direct, literal description of a component of the altar.

In biblical Hebrew, "יָם" is commonly used to denote the west direction because the Mediterranean Sea lies to the west of the land of Israel.

While "shoulder" refers to an anatomical part of a human or animal, here it describes a side or section of an inanimate structure (the Tabernacle courtyard).\n    *   **Reasoning for inclusion:** The Tabernacle courtyard does not literally possess a "shoulder" in the anatomical sense. The term is borrowed from the domain of living beings (human/animal body parts) and applied to an inanimate object (a side of a structure) to describe its position or function as a lateral side or supporting part. This is a clear cross-domain comparison, making it a metaphor. It is not personification because it does not attribute human actions, emotions, or other human-like qualities, only a physical descriptor. It is a common metaphorical extension in Hebrew for geographical features (e.g., "shoulder of a mountain") and architectural elements.\n    *   **Borderline cases:** One might argue it\'s a conventionalized usage that has lost its metaphorical force, but the origin of the term\'s application to inanimate objects clearly stems from the anatomical sense, making it a living metaphor in the context of descriptive language.\n\n4.  **"עַמֻּדֵיהֶ֣ם שְׁלֹשָׁ֔ה" (their three posts):** I considered if "posts" could be symbolic or metonymic.

However, this is a straightforward command given to Moses concerning the people. It is standard narrative language describing a direct instruction. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וְיִקְח֨וּ אֵלֶ֜יךָ** (to bring you): This describes a literal action of the Israelites bringing something to Moses. There is no hidden meaning or comparison. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n3.  **שֶׁ֣מֶן זַ֥יִת זָ֛ךְ כָּתִ֖ית** (clear oil of beaten olives): This is a precise, literal description of the type and quality of oil required for the lamp. "Beaten olives" (כָּתִית) refers to the method of pressing the olives, not a metaphorical "beating." There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or other figurative element. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **לַמָּא֑וֹר** (for lighting): This states the literal purpose of the oil. It is not a metaphor for enlightenment or any other abstract concept, but for physical illumination. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **לְהַעֲלֹ֥ת נֵ֖ר תָּמִֽיד** (for kindling lamps regularly / to cause a lamp to go up continually):\n    *   I considered if **נֵר** (lamp) itself might be a metaphor for something else (e.g., God\'s word, life). However, in this context, it refers to the literal lamp in the Tabernacle.\n    *   I specifically considered **לְהַעֲלֹ֥ת נֵ֖ר** (leha\'alot ner - to cause a lamp to go up). The verb הֶעֱלָה (he\'elah) literally means "to cause to go up" or "to bring up." While a lamp does not literally "go up" in the sense of ascending into the air when lit, this phrase is a well-established idiomatic expression in Biblical Hebrew for "to light a lamp" or "to make a lamp burn." The "going up" refers to the flame rising or the lamp being set up to function and emit light. It\'s not a literal physical ascent of the lamp itself, nor is it a metaphor comparing the lamp to something that ascends. It is a conventional, fixed expression whose meaning is understood beyond the sum of its literal parts. This is a clear idiom.\n    *   **תָּמִֽיד** (tamid - regularly/continually): This is a literal adverb describing the duration of the lamp\'s burning.

While the "meeting" aspect refers to God\'s interaction with Israel, the name itself is a direct designation for the place, not a figurative comparison.

While it could be argued as a metonymy where the content (testimony) stands for the object (tablets), in biblical Hebrew, this term functions as a standard, almost proper noun, designation for these sacred objects and the covenant they embody. It is not a cross-domain comparison or a figurative substitution in the sense of an idiom like "mouth of YHWH." Given the instruction to be conservative with standard narrative language and the fact that this is a direct designation based on function, I have excluded it as figurative.\n\n4.  **יַעֲרֹךְ֩ אֹת֨וֹ אַהֲרֹ֧ן וּבָנָ֛יו (ya\'aroch oto Aharon u-vanav) - "Aaron and his sons shall set them up"**:\n    *   Considered: This describes a literal action.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase directly describes the actions of Aaron and his sons.

It is not figurative. Therefore, it is excluded.\n\n6.  **לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה (lifnei YHWH) - "before יהוה"**:\n    *   Considered: If this phrase is an idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a very common biblical idiom. Literally meaning "to the face of YHWH," it does not imply a literal physical face or standing directly in front of God\'s body. Instead, it signifies performing an action "in the presence of YHWH," "in the sight of YHWH," or "under divine observation and approval." This usage clearly fits the definition of a biblical idiom as per the instructions, especially considering the guideline that divine anthropomorphisms referring to God\'s body (like "God\'s finger") should be considered figurative if not literal. This phrase is included as an idiom.\n\n7.  **חֻקַּ֤ת עוֹלָם֙ (chukkat olam) - "a due for all time / an eternal statute"**:\n    *   Considered: If "for all time" or "eternal statute" might be hyperbole or figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a standard legal/religious phrase in the Bible indicating the perpetual nature of a commandment. It is a literal statement about the duration and permanence of the law, not an exaggeration or a figurative comparison. Therefore, it is excluded.\n\n8.  **לְדֹ֣רֹתָ֔ם (l\'dorotam) - "throughout their ages / for their generations"**:\n    *   Considered: This describes a literal scope.\n    *   Reasoning: The phrase specifies that the commandment applies to successive generations.

However, in this context, it is a direct command for a physical action of presenting Aaron and his sons for a specific role. It is a literal instruction for Moses to physically present them. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וְאֶת־בָּנָ֣יו אִתּ֗וֹ** (with his sons): This is a straightforward, literal statement indicating the inclusion of Aaron\'s sons. No figurative language is present.\n\n3.  **מִתּ֛וֹךְ בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל** (from among the Israelites): This phrase literally describes the origin or selection pool for Aaron and his sons. "From among" (מִתּוֹךְ) denotes a literal spatial or group selection. It is not a metaphor, metonymy, or any other form of figurative language.\n\n4.  **לְכַהֲנוֹ־לִ֑י** (to serve Me as priests): I considered if "serve Me" could be an idiom or a metaphor for deep devotion or exclusive service beyond the literal. However, "לְכַהֲנוֹ" specifically means "to act as a priest" or "to minister." The suffix "לִי" means "to Me." Thus, "to minister to Me" or "to serve Me as priests" is a precise and literal description of the function and duty of the priesthood. It defines their role and purpose directly, without employing a cross-domain comparison or an idiomatic expression that deviates from its literal meaning. The guidelines state that comparisons of role or function are not figurative, and this falls under a literal description of a designated role. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n5.  **אַהֲרֹ֕ן נָדָ֧ב וַאֲבִיה֛וּא אֶלְעָזָ֥ר וְאִיתָמָ֖ר בְּנֵ֥י אַהֲרֹֽן** (Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron): This is a literal enumeration of names and a genealogical statement.

However, the vestments are literally designed to confer dignity/honor upon Aaron by signifying his high office and to literally adorn him with beauty and splendor. The phrase describes the direct purpose and effect of the garments. In the ANE context, external symbols like elaborate vestments directly communicate and establish status, honor, and beauty.

My reasoning for excluding it is that it is standard, literal narrative language, introducing a list of items and an instruction. It describes a direct action and its object without any metaphorical, similetic, or personifying qualities.\n\n2.  **חֹ֤שֶׁן וְאֵפוֹד֙ וּמְעִ֔יל וּכְתֹ֥נֶת תַּשְׁבֵּ֖ץ מִצְנֶ֣פֶת וְאַבְנֵ֑ט** ("a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a fringed tunic, a headdress, and a sash"): This is a straightforward list of specific physical objects. I considered if any of these terms might be used metaphorically or metonymically. However, each term refers directly to a distinct piece of priestly attire. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or symbolic representation intended beyond their literal identity as garments.\n\n3.  **וְעָשׂ֨וּ בִגְדֵי־קֹ֜דֶשׁ** ("They shall make those sacral vestments"): I considered whether the term "sacral vestments" (בִגְדֵי־קֹ֜דֶשׁ) could be figurative. The Hebrew word קֹדֶשׁ (qodesh) means "holy" or "sacred." Describing the vestments as "holy" refers to their consecrated purpose and function within the cultic context, not a figurative quality. It is a literal description of their designated status and use, distinguishing them from ordinary clothing. Therefore, it is not a metaphor or any other type of figurative language.\n\n4.  **לְאַהֲרֹ֥ן אָחִ֛יךָ וּלְבָנָ֖יו** ("for your brother Aaron and his sons"): This phrase identifies the recipients of the vestments. It is a literal statement of relationship and intended beneficiaries. No figurative language is present here.\n\n5.  **לְכַהֲנוֹ־לִֽי** ("for priestly service to Me"): I considered if "service to Me" (לְכַהֲנוֹ־לִֽי) could be figurative. The verb לְכַהֵן means "to serve as a priest." The suffix לִֽי ("to Me") refers to God as the recipient of this priestly service. This is a literal statement describing the *function* or *role* of Aaron and his sons, which is to perform priestly duties for God. According to the guidelines, comparisons of role or function are explicitly *not* to be marked as figurative. Furthermore, the reference to God ("Me") is a direct, literal reference to the divine recipient of the service, consistent with how divine anthropomorphisms (when not referring to God\'s body) are treated as literal in the ANE context. There is no metaphorical representation of God or the act of service.\n\nIn conclusion, after careful examination of each phrase against the provided criteria, I found no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, hyperbole, metonymy, or idioms that would warrant classification as figurative language.

However, in the context of listing materials for the construction of the Tabernacle, "gold" refers literally to the raw material (metal) itself, which would then be worked. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **וְאֶת־הַתְּכֵלֶת (and the blue):** I considered if "blue" is a metonymy. In biblical Hebrew, when colors like "blue" (תְּכֵלֶת) are listed among materials for textiles, they commonly refer to the *yarn or fabric dyed that specific color*, rather than just the abstract color itself. This is a clear instance of metonymy where the characteristic attribute (color) stands for the substance (dyed yarn/fabric).\n\n3.  **וְאֶת־הָֽאַרְגָּמָ֑ן (and the purple):** Similar to "blue," I considered if "purple" is a metonymy. "Purple" (אַרְגָּמָן) functions identically to "blue" in this context, referring to the *yarn or fabric dyed purple*. This is also a clear metonymy.\n\n4.  **וְאֶת־תּוֹלַ֥עַת הַשָּׁנִ֖י (and the crimson yarns / worm of scarlet):** I considered if this phrase is a metonymy. The Hebrew literally translates to "worm of scarlet" or "scarlet worm." This refers to the cochineal insect (the "worm") from which the scarlet/crimson dye was extracted, and "scarlet" is the resulting color. In this context, both the source of the dye ("worm") and the resulting color ("scarlet") are used to represent the *yarn dyed crimson*. This is a strong case of metonymy, where the source and characteristic color stand for the dyed material.\n\n5.  **וְאֶת־הַשֵּֽׁשׁ (and the fine linen):** I considered if "fine linen" could be a metonymy for garments made of fine linen. However, similar to "gold," in the context of listing raw materials for construction, "fine linen" refers literally to the fabric itself. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nIn summary, "the blue," "the purple," and "the crimson yarns" are identified as metonymy because the colors/dye source stand for the dyed yarn/fabric. The other elements are literal descriptions of materials.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

When used in the context of materials for weaving, they stand for the *yarns or threads dyed with these colors*. The text does not explicitly state "yarns of blue," but rather lists "blue," "purple," and "crimson" as materials alongside "gold" and "linen." This is a common linguistic shortcut where an attribute (the color/dye) stands for the material possessing that attribute (the dyed yarn). This constitutes metonymy. The English translation clarifies this by adding "yarns," which implicitly acknowledges the metonymic usage in the Hebrew. This is a clear instance of metonymy, where the color/dye is substituted for the material.\n\n4.  **וְשֵׁ֥שׁ מׇשְׁזָ֖ר** (and of fine twisted linen):\n    *   Considered if "fine twisted linen" could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal description of a specific type of fabric.

No figurative language.\n\nBorderline cases: The use of color terms for dyed materials is a very common linguistic convention in biblical Hebrew. While it might be considered "standard narrative language" in a broad sense, the prompt specifically asks to identify metonymy. Since the Hebrew literally lists colors as materials, implying the dyed material, it fits the definition of metonymy where an attribute stands for the object. Therefore, it is marked as metonymy.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It does not liken the stones to something else (metaphor/simile), nor does it attribute human qualities to them (personification). It is not a clear cross-domain comparison. The instruction emphasizes being conservative with standard narrative language and only marking "clear metaphors," "obvious similes," or "biblical idioms." This phrase falls more into the category of a literal statement of purpose within standard narrative. Therefore, it is excluded as figurative.\n\n3.  **"וְנָשָׂא֩ אַהֲרֹ֨ן אֶת־שְׁמוֹתָ֜ם" (Aaron shall carry their names)**\n    *   **Considered**: If this phrase is metonymy.\n    *   **Reasoning**: Aaron does not literally carry the abstract concept of "names." He carries the physical stones upon which the names are inscribed. In this context, "names" (שְׁמוֹתָם) stand in for the "people" (בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל) they represent. This is a clear instance of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where a part—the names—represents the whole—the people, or the abstract concept represents the concrete object bearing it). The act of carrying the names is a figurative way of expressing the responsibility of representing the Israelite people before YHWH. This is marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **"לִפְנֵ֧י יְהֹוָ֛ה" (before יהוה)**\n    *   **Considered**: If this phrase is an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning**: This is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not refer to a literal physical location in front of God\'s body. Instead, it signifies being in the presence, sight, or awareness of YHWH, often in a ritual or spiritual context. The instruction explicitly states to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. This is marked as figurative.\n\n5.  **"עַל־שְׁתֵּ֥י כְתֵפָ֖יו לְזִכָּרֹֽן" (upon his two shoulder-pieces for remembrance)**\n    *   **Considered**: If "upon his two shoulder-pieces" or "for remembrance" might be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning**: "Upon his two shoulder-pieces" is a literal description of the physical location where the stones are carried. "For remembrance" is a repetition of the purpose discussed in point 2. Similar to point 2, it is a direct statement of purpose and not a clear metaphor, simile, personification, or idiom in itself. Therefore, these elements are excluded as figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 2, 'instances_recovered': 2, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The chains are *to be* braided, not merely *like* braiding while being something else. It is a literal instruction for their design and construction, specifying that their form should be that of braided work.

It merely uses a human body part to describe a part of an object.\n    *   *Reasoning for excluding a fresh metaphor:* While it originates from a comparison, the use of שְׂפָה for "edge" of a garment, vessel, or river bank is extremely common and conventionalized in Biblical Hebrew. It is not a striking, novel cross-domain comparison intended to create a vivid new image, but rather a standard, almost fossilized, way of referring to the boundary or rim of an object.\n    *   *Reasoning for including as an idiom:* The guidelines state, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." The use of "lip" for "edge" is a well-established and conventionalized expression in Hebrew for the boundary or rim of various objects.

The instructions explicitly state that "פְּנ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה" (face of the earth) is an idiom. This guidance strongly indicates that using "פָּנִים" to refer to the front or surface of an inanimate object is to be classified as an idiom, as its meaning ("front surface") is not strictly deducible from the individual words without understanding this conventional usage. It does not attribute human-like consciousness, emotion, or action to the ephod, but rather uses a body part term to describe a spatial orientation.

While he literally carries the *stones with the names*, the phrase "carry the names of the sons of Israel" is not merely about the inscriptions but about carrying the *identity and representation* of the people into the divine presence.

This is a literal description of its placement. While the act of carrying the names *over his heart* implies a deep responsibility, the phrase itself describes a physical location.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n4.  **"בְּבֹא֣וֹ אֶל־הַקֹּ֑דֶשׁ" (when he enters the sanctuary):**\n    *   **Considered:** This describes a straightforward action.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal description of Aaron\'s movement into a physical location.\n    *   **Decision:** Not figurative.\n\n5.  **"לְזִכָּרֹ֥ן לִפְנֵֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה תָּמִֽיד" (for remembrance before יהוה at all times):**\n    *   **Considered:**\n        *   If "remembrance" (זִכָּרֹן) for YHWH is personification of God\'s memory.\n        *   If "before YHWH" (לִפְנֵֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה) is an idiom.\n    *   **Reasoning for "remembrance":** According to the guidelines, divine anthropomorphisms (like God\'s mental states or actions) are to be treated as literal in the ANE context unless they refer to God\'s body.

It is not a cross-domain comparison or a substitution of a related concept; rather, it directly names the object by its purpose. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **הָאוּרִים֙ וְאֶת־הַתֻּמִּ֔ים (hāʾûrîm wəʾet-hattummîm) - "Urim and Thummim"**:\n    *   Considered if these proper nouns for cultic objects are figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: These are specific names for concrete items used in the cult. While their exact nature and function are debated, they refer to literal objects. Therefore, they are not figurative.\n\n3.  **וְהָיוּ֙ עַל־לֵ֣ב אַהֲרֹ֔ן (wəhāyû ʿal-lēḇ ʾahărōn) - "so that they are over Aaron’s heart"**:\n    *   Considered if "over Aaron\'s heart" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase describes the literal physical placement of the breastpiece (containing the Urim and Thummim) on Aaron\'s chest, directly over his heart. It is a straightforward spatial description. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n4.  **בְּבֹא֖וֹ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה (bəḇōʾô lifnê YHWH) - "when he comes before יהוה"**:\n    *   Considered if "before יהוה" is a literal spatial description or an idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: "לִפְנֵי יְהֹוָה" (lifnê YHWH) is a well-established biblical idiom meaning "in the presence of YHWH" or "to serve YHWH" in a cultic context. It does not imply a literal physical front or face of God, but rather entering a sacred space or performing a sacred duty where God\'s presence is manifested. This falls under the instruction to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type. Therefore, it is figurative (idiom).\n\n5.  **וְנָשָׂ֣א אַ֠הֲרֹ֠ן אֶת־מִשְׁפַּ֨ט בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֧ל (wənāśāʾ ʾahărōn ʾet-mišpaṭ bənê-yiśrāʾēl) - "Aaron shall carry the judgment of the Israelites" (literal Hebrew)**:\n    *   Considered if "carry the judgment of the Israelites" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: Aaron does not literally carry an abstract concept of "judgment" (מִשְׁפָּט). Instead, he carries the physical breastpiece which contains the Urim and Thummim, the instruments through which divine judgment or decision is obtained. This is a metonymy where the abstract outcome or function ("judgment") is represented by the concrete instrument or means ("the breastpiece/Urim and Thummim") that facilitates it. The English translation "carry the instrument of decision" already interprets this metonymy, but the Hebrew itself uses the abstract "judgment." Therefore, it is figurative (metonymy).\n\n6.  **עַל־לִבּ֛וֹ (ʿal-libbô) - "over his heart"**:\n    *   Considered if "over his heart" in this second instance is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: Similar to the earlier instance, this refers to the literal physical placement of the breastpiece on Aaron\'s chest. While "heart" can be figurative for mind/emotions, in this context, it specifies the physical location where the breastpiece is worn. The primary meaning is literal. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n7.  **לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה (lifnê YHWH) - "before יהוה"**:\n    *   Considered if "before יהוה" is a literal spatial description or an idiom.\n    *   Reasoning: This is the same idiom as discussed in point 4, referring to being in God\'s presence or serving Him in a cultic context. Therefore, it is figurative (idiom).\n\n8.  **תָּמִֽיד (tāmîd) - "at all times"**:\n    *   Considered if "at all times" is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a literal adverb indicating continuous action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 3, 'instances_recovered': 3, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

It states a physical characteristic, not a symbolic representation.\n    *   **Considered if it might be metonymy/synecdoche:** Metonymy involves using a closely associated concept to refer to the thing itself (e.g., "the crown" for royalty). Synecdoche uses a part to represent the whole or vice versa. "Pure blue" describes the *color* and *completeness* of the robe\'s material.

However, "פִּי" is commonly used in Hebrew for various types of openings (e.g., mouth of a well, mouth of a cave, opening of a sack). In this context, it functions as a standard, literal descriptor for the opening of a garment. It is not a fresh, cross-domain comparison but a conventional extension of meaning. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n    *   **"בְּתוֹכ֑וֹ" (in the middle of it):** This is a literal spatial description. I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"שָׂפָ֡ה יִֽהְיֶה֩ לְפִ֨יו סָבִ֜יב מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה אֹרֵ֗ג" (the opening shall have a binding of woven work round about):**\n    *   **"שָׂפָ֡ה יִֽהְיֶה֩ לְפִ֨יו" (a lip/edge shall be for its opening):** I considered if "שָׂפָה" (lip) used for the edge of a garment\'s opening might be a metaphor. While "שָׂפָה" primarily means "lip" of a person, it is also conventionally used for the "edge" or "border" of various objects (e.g., "lip of the sea," "lip of a vessel"). In the context of a garment, it refers to a reinforced edge or binding. This is a conventional, almost technical, usage rather than a living metaphor intended to evoke the image of a human lip. It falls under standard descriptive language for an edge. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n    *   **"מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה אֹרֵ֗ג" (woven work):** This is a literal description of the material and craftsmanship. I excluded it as figurative.\n\n3.  **"כְּפִ֥י תַחְרָ֛א יִֽהְיֶה־לּ֖וֹ" (it shall be like the opening of a coat of mail):**\n    *   I considered this phrase as a potential simile. The Hebrew particle "כְּ" (like/as) explicitly introduces a comparison. The opening of the ephod is directly compared to the opening of a coat of mail (תַחְרָא). This is a clear and obvious simile, comparing the physical characteristic of one object\'s opening to another\'s to convey a quality (strength, durability). This fits the criteria for "obvious similes" that should be marked as figurative.\n\n4.  **"לֹ֥א יִקָּרֵֽעַ" (so that it does not tear):**\n    *   This is a literal statement of purpose or consequence.

However, the text is describing a physical object made of a specific material. The primary meaning is literal: a bell made of gold. There is no cross-domain comparison or implied non-literal meaning.\n2.  **"וְרִמּ֔וֹן" (and a pomegranate):** I considered if the "pomegranate" might be symbolic of fertility, abundance, or other common associations with this fruit in ancient cultures.

This phrase is a well-established biblical idiom for being "in the presence of YHWH" or "in the sight of YHWH," especially in a cultic context. It does not imply that YHWH has a physical face in the human sense that Aaron stands before, but rather denotes a state of being in God\'s immediate sphere of influence, attention, or judgment. The guidelines also state that divine anthropomorphisms are literal *unless they refer to God\'s body*. However, the explicit instruction to classify biblical idioms as such, and the inclusion of "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of YHWH) as an idiom, strongly suggests that "לִפְנֵ֧י יְהֹוָ֛ה" should also be treated as an idiom, as it functions as a set phrase conveying a specific, non-literal meaning of presence rather than a direct physical description of God\'s anatomy.

Aaron does not physically "carry" sin as one would a tangible object. Instead, his role, symbolized by the plate on his forehead, is to atone for, neutralize, or take responsibility for the ritual impurities and unintentional sins associated with the Israelites\' holy offerings. This is a functional, theological concept expressed through the imagery of bearing a burden. It is classified as an idiom.\n    *   Borderline: This is not particularly borderline, as "bearing sin" is a common idiomatic expression in Hebrew scripture for atonement or responsibility.\n\n3.  **"אֲשֶׁ֤ר יַקְדִּ֙ישׁוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לְכׇֽל־מַתְּנֹ֖ת קׇדְשֵׁיהֶ֑ם" / "that the Israelites consecrate, from any of their sacred donations"**:\n    *   Considered: If "consecrate" or "sacred donations" could be figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: These terms describe literal actions (consecrating) and objects (donations) within the cultic context of ancient Israel. They are standard religious terminology, not figurative language. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n4.  **"וְהָיָ֤ה עַל־מִצְחוֹ֙ תָּמִ֔יד" / "it shall be on his forehead at all times"**:\n    *   Considered: If "תָּמִיד" (tamid, "at all times" or "continually") could be hyperbole.\n    *   Reasoning: In the context of priestly duties, "at all times" refers to the plate being worn whenever Aaron is performing his sacred functions, which is the expected and literal duration for such an object. It signifies a constant requirement during service, not an exaggeration for rhetorical effect. Therefore, it is literal.\n\n5.  **"לְרָצ֥וֹן לָהֶ֖ם לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה" / "to win acceptance for them before יהוה"**:\n    *   Considered: If "לְרָצ֥וֹן לָהֶ֖ם" ("to win acceptance for them") is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This phrase describes the desired outcome of Aaron\'s actions – that the Israelites\' offerings and service be acceptable to God. This is a standard theological concept of divine favor or approval, not figurative language. Therefore, it is literal.\n    *   Considered: If "לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה" (lifnei YHWH, "before YHWH") is figurative.\n    *   Reasoning: This is a very common biblical idiom. While literally translating to "before the face of YHWH," it does not imply a literal physical face or a literal spatial position in front of God as one would stand before a human. Instead, it signifies being in God\'s presence, under God\'s observation, or in a place where God\'s presence is manifested (e.g., the Tabernacle). As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." Therefore, it is an idiom.\n    *   Borderline: The instruction regarding divine anthropomorphisms ("unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)") could make "face" (פנים) seem like a literal body part.

However, in this context, it refers to the literal act of putting on specific priestly garments, which are described in detail in the preceding verses (Exodus 28). While garments can symbolize status, the verb "clothe" here describes a direct, physical instruction for the ordination ceremony. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n2.  **"וּמָשַׁחְתָּ֨ אֹתָ֜ם" (and you shall anoint them):** I considered if "anoint" could be a metaphor for consecrating or setting apart in a non-literal sense. Anointing with oil was a literal ritual act in the ancient Near East and biblical tradition, signifying consecration and setting apart for a specific role. The act itself is physical and direct. While it *symbolizes* consecration, the verb "anoint" itself describes the literal action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n3.  **"וּמִלֵּאתָ֧ אֶת־יָדָ֛ם" (and you shall fill their hands):** I considered if this was a literal instruction or an idiom for ordination. The phrase "fill their hands" (מִלֵּא יָד) is a well-established biblical idiom for the act of ordaining or consecrating someone to a priestly office. While the ordination ceremony involved the literal placement of sacrificial portions into the hands of the priests (e.g., Exod 29:24; Lev 8:27-28), the phrase itself, when used to describe the *process* of ordination, functions as a technical term or idiom for investing with priestly authority and responsibility. It goes beyond the mere physical act to denote the conferral of office. The English translation\'s note "Lit. \'and fill their hands\'" further supports its idiomatic nature. This is a clear case of an idiom.\n4.  **"וְקִדַּשְׁתָּ֥ אֹתָ֖ם" (and you shall consecrate them):** I considered if "consecrate" could be figurative. "Consecrate" (קדש) is a direct verb meaning to make holy or set apart for sacred use. It describes the intended outcome of the ritual actions. While the *state* of being consecrated is abstract, the verb itself describes the direct action of making something holy. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n5.  **"וְכִהֲנ֥וּ לִֽי" (and they shall serve Me as priests):** I considered if "serve as priests" could be figurative. This describes the function and role of the individuals. It is a direct statement of their future service. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\nBased on this analysis, only "וּמִלֵּאתָ֧ אֶת־יָדָ֛ם" is identified as figurative language, specifically an idiom.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

The purpose of the breeches is to *physically cover* the *physical nakedness*. It is not using an indirect term to avoid a harsh one (euphemism in the modern sense), nor is it using an associated concept to stand in for the actual thing (metonymy). It is a literal, albeit specific, description of the area.

The verb נשׂא (nasa\', "to carry") is commonly used in biblical Hebrew with abstract nouns like עָוֺן (avon, "iniquity," "guilt," "punishment") to express the idea of bearing the consequences, responsibility, or punishment for sin. This is not a literal physical carrying of a burden, but a conventional, fixed expression. As per the instructions, "Biblical idioms and set phrases... classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type."

It is not figurative here.\n    *   I considered if "זֶרַע" (zera\', "seed") used for "offspring" or "descendants" is metonymy. The literal meaning of זֶרַע is "seed" (as in plant seed). In this context, it refers to the biological descendants of Aaron. This is a classic example of metonymy (specifically, synecdoche, where the source/origin stands for the product/result). Although it is a very common and almost lexicalized usage in biblical Hebrew, it still represents a figurative extension of the word\'s primary meaning. The instructions explicitly state that synecdoche is a type of metonymy and to consider metonymy in the deliberation.

However, this is a literal, straightforward introductory statement of instruction, setting the stage for the actions to follow. It does not employ any figurative language.\n2.  **לְקַדֵּ֥שׁ אֹתָ֖ם** (in consecrating them): I considered if "consecrating" (לְקַדֵּשׁ) could be a metaphor for a transformation or a symbolic act beyond its literal meaning. In a religious context, "consecrating" is a technical term for a ritual act of setting something or someone apart for sacred service. It describes a literal religious procedure, not a figurative comparison or symbolic representation of something else.\n3.  **לְכַהֵ֣ן לִ֑י** (to serve Me as priests): I considered if "serve Me as priests" could be a metaphor for a deeper spiritual relationship or an idiom for a specific type of service. This phrase literally describes the function and role of the individuals being consecrated. "To serve as priests" (לְכַהֵן) is the direct verb for performing priestly duties.

While "son of" (בן) can sometimes be used metaphorically or for personification in other contexts, in the context of animals, "בֶּן־בָּקָר" is a well-established Hebrew idiom to denote a young bull or calf. It is a fixed expression used for classification by age or type, rather than implying a literal familial relationship or a comparison to a human son. It falls under the category of "Biblical idioms and set phrases" as it\'s a conventional way of speaking about animals in Hebrew that doesn\'t derive its meaning simply from the individual words in a strictly literal sense. I debated whether the "son of" construct might imply a mild personification, but its primary function here is a standard classification, making "idiom" the most appropriate classification according to the guidelines.\n5.  **וְאֵילִ֥ם שְׁנַ֖יִם תְּמִימִֽם** (and two rams without blemish): I considered if "without blemish" (תְּמִימִֽם) could be a metaphor for moral purity or spiritual perfection. However, in the context of sacrificial animals, "without blemish" refers to the literal physical perfection required for the offering. It is a direct descriptive adjective specifying a physical quality, not a figurative representation of an abstract concept.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

There is no indication that the headdress or head is standing in for a broader concept or that the action is symbolic beyond its literal performance. It is a standard narrative description of an action. Therefore, it is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"וְנָתַתָּ֛ אֶת־נֵ֥זֶר הַקֹּ֖דֶשׁ" (and place the holy diadem):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "נֵזֶר הַקֹּדֶשׁ" ("holy diadem") might be a metaphor for sacred authority or a metonymy for the priesthood itself. Also considered if "holy" (הַקֹּדֶשׁ) could be personification or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "נֵזֶר" (diadem) is a literal object, a specific piece of priestly attire. The adjective "הַקֹּדֶשׁ" (the holy) describes its inherent ritual status and purpose, indicating that it is consecrated or set apart for sacred use. In the ANE context, an object being "holy" is a literal theological and ritual designation, not a figurative description of its physical properties or a personification. It denotes its function and origin within a sacred sphere. While the diadem *represents* sacred authority, its description here is literal: it *is* a holy diadem. The text does not say the diadem *is* authority, but that it *is* holy. Therefore, this is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"עַל־הַמִּצְנָֽפֶת" (upon the headdress):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether this prepositional phrase could imply a figurative relationship or hierarchy.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward, literal spatial description of where the diadem is to be placed relative to the headdress. It indicates a physical location, not a figurative one.

However, in this context, it refers literally to the physical substance used in the ritual. The oil is the direct object to be taken, not a figurative stand-in for an abstract concept. The act of anointing *with* the oil carries symbolic weight, but the oil itself is described literally.\n\n2.  **וְיָצַקְתָּ֖ עַל־רֹאשׁ֑וֹ (and pour it on his head):** I considered if "head" could be a synecdoche for the entire person or a metonymy for authority or leadership. However, pouring oil on the head was a literal and specific physical action in ancient Near Eastern anointing rituals. The text describes the precise location for the application of the oil. While the act of anointing the head symbolizes consecration and authority, the description of pouring on the head is a literal account of the physical action, not a figurative representation of the person or their office.\n\n3.  **וּמָשַׁחְתָּ֖ אֹתֽוֹ (and anoint him):** I considered if the verb "anoint" (מָשַׁח) could be a metonymy for the act of consecration or appointment to office. However, "anoint" is the direct and literal verb describing the ritual act of applying oil. While this ritual act *results* in consecration and appointment, the verb itself describes the physical action. The *purpose* or *effect* of the anointing is symbolic, but the word "anoint" is the literal description of the ritual itself, not a figurative way of expressing its outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, the verse provides a straightforward, literal description of a ritual action.

While the *act* of laying hands in cultic contexts carries profound symbolic meaning (e.g., identification, transfer of sin, blessing), the *description* of the action itself is literal. Aaron and his sons are physically placing their hands on the bull. The guidelines state that "character actions... are LITERAL" unless they refer to God\'s body.

However, this is a direct, literal instruction to select specific animal parts for a ritual. The language is precise and descriptive, not metaphorical or symbolic in a figurative sense. Therefore, I excluded it as figurative.\n\n2.  **"turn them into smoke upon the altar" (וְהִקְטַרְתָּ֖ הַמִּזְבֵּֽחָה)**: I considered if this phrase might be a metaphor, metonymy, or an idiom.\n    *   **Metaphor/Simile/Personification**: The phrase describes a direct physical action: causing the animal parts to burn and produce smoke on the altar. There is no comparison to another domain, no "likening" to something else, and no attribution of human qualities to non-human entities. Thus, it is not a metaphor, simile, or personification.\n    *   **Metonymy**: I considered if "turn into smoke" could be a metonymy for "offer as a sacrifice." However, in the context of burnt offerings (olah), the act of burning the offering and causing it to ascend as smoke *is* the primary physical action of the sacrifice. The Hebrew verb הִקְטִיר (hiqṭir) itself, in the Hiphil, means "to cause to smoke" or "to offer by burning." Therefore, the phrase directly describes the ritual action rather than standing in for a different, broader concept. It is not a part standing for a whole, or an attribute standing for the thing. It is the action itself.\n    *   **Idiom**: I considered if this phrase functions as a biblical idiom or set phrase. While it is a technical term for a specific ritual action frequently used in sacrificial contexts, its meaning is directly derived from the literal components of causing smoke to rise from burning. Unlike idioms such as "face of the earth" where "face" is not literal, "smoke" is literally produced. The phrase describes the physical process of the offering, which is also its ritual function. It does not convey a meaning that is significantly different from the literal sum of its parts.

The text explicitly lists these parts for a specific ritual action. There is no cross-domain comparison or substitution of a related concept for the literal one. Therefore, this is not figurative.\n\n2.  **"תִּשְׂרֹ֣ף בָּאֵ֔שׁ"** (shall be put to the fire / you shall burn in the fire):\n    *   **Considered:** If "fire" could be a metaphor for destruction, judgment, or purification in a non-literal sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In this context, "fire" is the literal element used to physically burn the specified parts of the bull. The action described is a literal burning. While the act of burning might have symbolic significance within the ritual, the phrase itself describes a literal physical process. Therefore, this is not figurative.\n\n3.  **"מִח֖וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֑ה"** (outside the camp):\n    *   **Considered:** If "outside the camp" could be a metaphor for impurity, exclusion, or separation in a non-literal, abstract sense.\n    *   **Reasoning:** This phrase provides a literal spatial instruction for where the burning is to take place. The location is physically outside the boundaries of the camp. While the act of burning impure elements outside the camp carries significant symbolic meaning regarding ritual purity and separation, the phrase itself is a literal geographical descriptor.

The primary meaning of חַטָּאת is "sin," but in cultic contexts, it refers to the offering itself.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In biblical Hebrew cultic language, חַטָּאת functions as a technical term for a specific type of offering (an offering for sin or purification). The statement "it is a sin offering" is a direct, literal classification of the bull\'s cultic identity and purpose within the ritual system. It is not stating that the bull *is like* sin, but that it *is* the designated offering known as a חַטָּאת. This is an identification of its function, not a figurative comparison or substitution. Given the conservative instructions, especially regarding standard narrative language and technical terms, this is considered a literal statement of classification. Therefore, this is not figurative.\n\n**Conclusion:** After careful deliberation, I find no instances of clear metaphors, similes, personification, or idioms (in the sense of non-literal fixed phrases) in this verse.

However, the guidelines specify that biblical idioms are phrases where the meaning cannot be deduced from the literal words (e.g., "mouth of the sword" for "edge of the sword"). In this case, "lay hands" literally means to place hands. The *significance* or *purpose* of the act is symbolic, but the *linguistic description* of the act remains literal. The instruction to be "conservative with standard narrative language" and "character actions" reinforces that literal descriptions of actions, even ritual ones, should not be marked as figurative unless there is a clear linguistic departure from literal meaning.

The act of sprinkling blood onto the altar is a concrete, physical action within the ritual. "All sides" or "around" is a literal spatial description of where the blood is to be applied.

"Turn into smoke" is a direct description of the physical transformation of the offering through fire. "All of the ram" and "upon the altar" are literal descriptions of the object and location.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not figurative.\n\n2.  **"עֹלָ֥ה ה֖וּא לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה" / "It is a burnt offering to יהוה"**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "burnt offering" or "to יהוה" could be figurative.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Burnt offering" (עֹלָה, `olah`) is a technical, literal term for a specific type of sacrifice.

While an odor can be literally pleasing to humans, attributing "pleasing" to God\'s perception of an odor is an anthropomorphic expression. God does not possess a physical nose to literally smell in the human physiological sense. Therefore, this phrase uses human sensory experience to describe God\'s disposition.\n        *   According to the instructions, "Biblical idions and set phrases... these are IDIOMS; classify figurative idioms as \'idiom\' type." This phrase clearly fits the definition of a biblical idiom.\n        *   Furthermore, it functions as a metaphor, likening God\'s acceptance (an abstract concept) to the human experience of finding an aroma pleasing (a concrete sensory experience). This is a clear cross-domain comparison.\n        *   The instruction regarding divine anthropomorphisms states they are literal "unless they refer to God\'s body (God\'s finger)." The concept of "smelling" or finding an odor "pleasing" refers to a bodily sense, making it figurative in this context.\n    *   **Borderline Cases/Debate:** The primary debate was whether to classify it solely as an idiom, or also as a metaphor, given its anthropomorphic nature. The instructions allow for multiple figurative types. Since it\'s a set phrase, "idiom" is appropriate.

However, in the context of the instruction to "lay their hands upon the ram\'s head," the physical hands are the literal instruments performing the action.

In the context of a sacrificial ritual, "slaughtering a ram" refers precisely to the act of killing the animal for the purpose of the offering. There is no cross-domain comparison or non-literal meaning intended. It falls under "standard narrative language" and "character actions" (or commanded actions), which are to be treated conservatively as literal.\n\n2.  **"and take some of its blood" (וְלָקַחְתָּ֤ מִדָּמוֹ֙):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether "blood" (דָּם) could be a metonymy for life, atonement, or the essence of the sacrifice.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While blood carries profound symbolic and theological significance in the ancient Near East and biblical tradition (representing life, atonement, etc.), in this specific instruction, "blood" refers literally to the physical fluid taken from the ram. The command is to physically "take" the substance. The text is describing a literal handling of a physical object, not using "blood" as a figurative stand-in for an abstract concept within the grammatical structure of the sentence. The guidelines require "clear metaphors," "personification," "obvious similes," or "idioms," and this usage does not meet those criteria for figurative language.\n\n3.  **"and put it on the ridge of Aaron’s right ear and on the ridges of his sons’ right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet" (וְנָֽתַתָּ֡ה עַל־תְּנוּךְ֩ אֹ֨זֶן אַהֲרֹ֜ן וְעַל־תְּנ֨וּךְ אֹ֤זֶן בָּנָיו֙ הַיְמָנִ֔ית וְעַל־בֹּ֤הֶן יָדָם֙ הַיְמָנִ֔ית וְעַל־בֹּ֥הֶן רַגְלָ֖ם הַיְמָנִ֑ית):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether the specific body parts (ear, thumb, big toe) could be functioning as synecdoche or metonymy, where the part represents a broader function or concept (e.g., ear for hearing/obedience, hand for action/service, foot for walking/path).\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a literal description of a ritual action. The blood is physically applied to these precise anatomical locations. While these actions are deeply symbolic within the ritual context (consecrating the senses, actions, and movement of the priests), the language used to describe the action itself is direct and literal. The text is not saying "consecrate their hearing" by using "ear" as a figurative representation; it is literally instructing to put blood *on the ear*. The instruction focuses on the physical act, not a figurative representation of a concept. This falls under "standard narrative language" and "character actions," which are to be interpreted literally.\n\n4.  **"and dash the rest of the blood against every side of the altar round about" (וְזָרַקְתָּ֧ אֶת־הַדָּ֛ם עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֖חַ סָבִֽיב):**\n    *   **Considered:** Whether the verb "dash" (וְזָרַקְתָּ֧) could be a metaphorical use of a strong verb, or if "altar" (מִּזְבֵּ֖חַ) could be a metonymy for God\'s presence or the act of atonement.\n    *   **Reasoning:** "Dash" is a literal verb describing the physical action of throwing or splashing the blood. The "altar" is a physical object. The instruction describes a literal physical action performed on a literal physical object. No figurative language is present.\n\n**Borderline Cases Debated:**\nThe primary area of deliberation involved the potential for metonymy or synecdoche concerning "blood" and the specific body parts. However, the guiding principle to "BE CONSERVATIVE WITH: Standard narrative language" and to "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of role or function" led to the conclusion that these are literal descriptions of ritual actions. While the *ritual itself* is highly symbolic, the *language describing the ritual* is direct and literal. The text instructs a physical action on a physical object/body part, rather than using the object/part to figuratively represent an abstract concept. Therefore, no elements were ultimately classified as figurative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter a thorough examination of each phrase and concept in the verse, I find no instances of clear metaphors, personification, obvious similes, or biblical idioms as defined by the provided guidelines.

Similarly, referring to "Aaron and his vestments" is a literal description of the recipients of the sprinkling, not a figurative representation of a broader concept. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or obvious simile present.\n\n3.  **"וְקָדַ֥שׁ הוּא֙ וּבְגָדָ֔יו וּבָנָ֛יו וּבִגְדֵ֥י בָנָ֖יו אִתּֽוֹ" (Thus shall he and his vestments be holy, as well as his sons and his sons’ vestments)**\n    *   **Considered:** I considered if "be holy" (וְקָדַשׁ) when applied to inanimate objects like "vestments" (בְּגָדָיו) might constitute personification or a metaphor.\n    *   **Reasoning:** In the biblical cultic context, "holy" (קָדַשׁ) refers to a state of being set apart for divine service, consecrated, or made sacred. This is a literal change in ritual status and function for both people and objects within the biblical worldview. Vestments, when consecrated, are literally set apart for sacred use and acquire a holy status. This is not a figurative comparison (e.g., the vestments are *like* something holy) nor is it attributing human qualities to an inanimate object (e.g., the vestments *feel* holy). It is a direct statement of their transformed ritual classification. Therefore, this is not figurative language.\n\n**Borderline Cases:** No phrases in this verse presented as borderline cases that would lead to marking them as figurative under the given conservative guidelines. The text is a direct, prescriptive instruction regarding a ritual and its literal cultic outcome.\n\nNo figurative language was found in this verse.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

However, the text explicitly lists these as literal anatomical components to be taken *from* the ram. They are not used to represent something else, but are the direct objects of the instruction. Therefore, this is a literal description.\n\n2.  **"the fat that covers the entrails" (וְאֶת־הַחֵ֣לֶב&thinsp;׀ הַֽמְכַסֶּ֣ה אֶת־הַקֶּ֗רֶב):** This is a straightforward, literal anatomical description of a specific type of fat found in the animal. There is no cross-domain comparison, personification, or idiomatic usage.\n\n3.  **"the protuberance on the liver" (וְאֵ֨ת יֹתֶ֤רֶת הַכָּבֵד֙):** This phrase refers to a specific anatomical part of the liver, often understood as the caudate lobe or a fatty appendage. It is a technical, literal term for a physical component. No figurative language is present.\n\n4.  **"the two kidneys with the fat on them" (וְאֵ֣ת&thinsp;׀ שְׁתֵּ֣י הַכְּלָיֹ֗ת וְאֶת־הַחֵ֙לֶב֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עֲלֵיהֶ֔ן):** This is another precise, literal description of organs and their associated fat. It functions as a direct instruction regarding the physical parts of the ram.\n\n5.  **"and the right thigh" (וְאֵ֖ת שׁ֣וֹק הַיָּמִ֑ין):** This is a literal anatomical designation of a specific limb of the animal. No figurative meaning is implied.\n\n6.  **"for this is a ram of ordination" (כִּ֛י אֵ֥יל מִלֻּאִ֖ים הֽוּא):** I considered if "ram of ordination" (אֵ֥יל מִלֻּאִ֖ים) could be a metaphor or metonymy. However, "מִלֻּאִ֖ים" (millu\'im) is a technical term in biblical Hebrew referring to the consecration or ordination ceremony, specifically the "filling of the hands" of the priests. Therefore, "ram of ordination" is a literal classification of the ram\'s purpose and function within the ritual context. It directly states what the ram *is* in terms of its ritual role, rather than comparing it to something else or using a part to represent a whole. It is a literal designation, not a figurative one.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire verse consists of literal, descriptive language pertaining to the anatomical parts of a sacrificial animal and its ritual designation.

Reasoning: While "פנים" (face) is a body part, the phrase "לִפְנֵי יְהֹוָה" is a well-established biblical idiom. It does not refer to God having a literal physical face in the human sense that an object is placed directly in front of. Instead, it idiomatically signifies being "in the presence of Yahweh" or "dedicated to Yahweh" within a sacred, cultic context (e.g., at the altar or tabernacle). The instruction explicitly states to classify biblical idioms as "idiom" type, and provides "פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה" (mouth of Yahweh) as an example, which also involves a divine body part used idiomatically. Therefore, this phrase is classified as an idiom.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

"לִפְנֵי יְהֹוָה" falls into this category, signifying "in the presence of God" or "to God" rather than a literal physical location in front of God\'s face.
