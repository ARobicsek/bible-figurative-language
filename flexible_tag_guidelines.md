# Flexible Tag-Based Biblical Figurative Language Classification

## REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH

This system moves from **rigid predefined tag lists** to **flexible rule-based tag generation**. The LLM classifier dynamically creates appropriate tags following structured principles, enabling comprehensive coverage of biblical figurative language diversity while maintaining analytical rigor.

**ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY PURPOSE: ENABLE SCHOLARLY RESEARCH**
Your tags will help biblical scholars, theologians, and researchers discover, compare, and analyze patterns in figurative language across biblical texts. Every tag should be designed with research utility in mind.

## THREE-DIMENSIONAL FRAMEWORK

### TARGET DIMENSION
**What is being described figuratively**

**Core Principle**: Tag the subject or referent receiving figurative description, from specific to general.

**Tagging Rules**:
```
- Use most specific applicable term first
- Add broader categorical tags as needed
- Include relational aspects if relevant to the figurative usage
- Consider both individual identity and functional role
```

**Hierarchical Tagging Examples**:
```
"Moses like a shepherd" â†’ ["moses", "prophet", "leader", "human_individual"]
"A stubborn wolf" â†’ ["wolf", "predator", "wild_animal", "animal", "fierce_creature"]
"The boiling pot" â†’ ["cooking_pot", "vessel", "container", "kitchen_implement", "artificial_object"]
```

**Search Discoverability Strategy**:
- **Specific searches**: "wolf" finds exact wolf imagery
- **Category searches**: "animal" finds all animal imagery (wolf, eagle, lion, etc.)
- **Domain searches**: "wild_animal" finds untamed creature imagery
- **Type searches**: "predator" finds all predatory animal imagery

### VEHICLE DIMENSION
**What imagery is used to describe the target**

**Core Principle**: Identify the source domain providing the metaphorical imagery, being as specific as possible.

**Tagging Rules**:
```
- Capture the precise image/vehicle used
- Include specific actions or behaviors when relevant
- Tag the broader conceptual domain
- Note sensory or experiential qualities that contribute
```

**Dynamic Examples**:
```
"Like a consuming fire" â†’ ["fire", "consuming_flame", "destructive_element", "purifying_force"]
"Hovering like a bird" â†’ ["bird", "hovering_motion", "protective_behavior", "aerial_creature"]
"Swift as a deer" â†’ ["deer", "swift_animal", "graceful_movement", "wild_creature"]
```

### GROUND DIMENSION (ENHANCED)
**What qualities of the target are being illuminated + Speaker's posture**

**Revolutionary Enhancement**: The Ground captures TWO critical aspects:
1. **Target Illumination**: What qualities, relationships, or aspects of the target are being revealed/highlighted
2. **Speaker Posture**: The speaker's attitude, stance, or emotional orientation toward the target

**Core Principle**: Focus on WHY the figurative language works - what it reveals about the target AND the speaker's perspective.

**Target Quality Categories**:
```
- essential_nature: Core identity, fundamental being
- physical_qualities: Size, strength, appearance, material properties
- functional_role: Purpose, what something DOES, operational aspects
- relational_dynamics: Connections, interactions, social bonds
- status_authority: Rank, position, power dynamics
- moral_ethical: Character, righteousness, accountability
- emotional_psychological: Feelings, mental states
- temporal_aspects: Permanence, duration, change
- experiential_reality: Lived experience, practical effects
- evaluative_qualities: Worth, value, desirability
```

**Speaker Posture Categories (REQUIRED)**:
```
- reverence_awe: Reverent, worshipful, awestruck
- affection_love: Loving, caring, tender
- anger_indignation: Angry, wrathful, indignant
- disappointment_grief: Disappointed, grieved, sorrowful
- warning_correction: Corrective, admonishing, warning
- celebration_praise: Celebratory, praising, honoring
- lament_mourning: Lamenting, mourning, grieving
- exasperation_frustration: Exasperated, frustrated, wearied
- protective_defensive: Protective, advocating
- condemnation_judgment: Condemning, judging, rejecting
- yearning_longing: Yearning, longing, desiring
- shame_regret: Ashamed, regretful, embarrassed
- hope_expectation: Hopeful, expectant, anticipating
- neutral_descriptive: Neutral, objective, descriptive
```

**Enhanced Ground Examples**:
```
"Israel like a stubborn heifer"
Ground: ["obstinate_behavior", "resistance_to_guidance", "disappointing_covenant_response", "exasperation_frustration"]

"God as a consuming fire"
Ground: ["purifying_holiness", "dangerous_to_approach", "awesome_power", "reverence_awe"]

"The righteous flourish like palm trees"
Ground: ["steady_growth", "enduring_strength", "fruitful_life", "celebration_praise"]
```

## DYNAMIC TAG GENERATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Contextual Analysis
```
1. Read the figurative text in its immediate context
2. Identify the literary genre (narrative, law, prophecy, wisdom, psalm)
3. Consider the speaker/author and intended audience
4. Note any obvious emotional or rhetorical undertones
```

### Step 2: Three-Dimensional Identification (Research-Focused)
```
TARGET: "What is receiving figurative description?"
- Be specific: names, roles, objects, concepts
- Include both identity and function if relevant
- ASK: "What would scholars want to search for?"

VEHICLE: "What imagery is being used?"
- Capture the actual metaphorical vehicle
- Include specific actions, qualities, or characteristics
- Note the source domain (human, animal, natural world, etc.)
- ASK: "How can researchers find similar imagery patterns?"

GROUND: "Why does this comparison work?"
- What target qualities are being highlighted?
- What is the speaker's attitude/stance?
- How does this serve the rhetorical purpose?
- ASK: "What patterns will scholars want to analyze?"
```

### Step 3: Dynamic Tag Creation
```
- Generate specific tags following naming conventions
- Ensure tags capture unique aspects without redundancy
- Include required speaker posture tag in ground dimension
- Validate coherence across all three dimensions
```

### Step 4: Scholarly Quality Validation
```
RESEARCH UTILITY: Will these tags help scholars discover meaningful patterns?
SEARCHABILITY: Do tags support both specific and broad comparative studies?
COMPLETENESS: Are all aspects captured that scholars might want to analyze?
PRECISION: Are tags appropriately specific for scholarly recognition?
COHERENCE: Do the three dimensions tell a coherent story?
BIBLICAL APPROPRIATENESS: Do tags reflect sound biblical understanding?
POSTURE IDENTIFICATION: Is speaker's stance clearly identified?
```

## EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

### Research Query Capabilities
```sql
-- Find instances where God is described with protective imagery
SELECT * FROM v_figurative_with_dynamic_tags
WHERE target_tags LIKE '%god%'
  AND ground_tags LIKE '%protective%';

-- Analyze speaker posture patterns in different books
SELECT book, speaker_posture_primary, COUNT(*)
FROM v_figurative_with_dynamic_tags
GROUP BY book, speaker_posture_primary
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Find instances of divine anger imagery
SELECT figurative_text, target_tags, vehicle_tags, ground_tags
FROM v_figurative_with_dynamic_tags
WHERE target_tags LIKE '%divine_anger%'
  OR ground_tags LIKE '%anger_indignation%';
```

### Pattern Discovery Examples
```sql
-- What imagery is used when speakers express exasperation?
SELECT DISTINCT vehicle_tags
FROM v_figurative_with_dynamic_tags
WHERE ground_tags LIKE '%exasperation_frustration%';

-- How do different books portray God's relationship with Israel?
SELECT book, COUNT(*) as instances, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ground_tags)
FROM v_figurative_with_dynamic_tags
WHERE target_tags LIKE '%israel%' AND target_tags LIKE '%god%'
GROUP BY book;
```

## VALIDATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Automated Validation Checks
```python
def validate_tag_assignment(target_tags, vehicle_tags, ground_tags):
    """
    Automated validation for dynamic tag assignments
    """
    errors = []

    # Check required elements
    if not any('speaker_posture_' in tag or tag in POSTURE_TAGS for tag in ground_tags):
        errors.append("Missing required speaker posture tag in ground dimension")

    # Check coherence
    if not validate_dimensional_coherence(target_tags, vehicle_tags, ground_tags):
        errors.append("Tags across dimensions don't form coherent interpretation")

    # Check specificity
    if not validate_appropriate_specificity(target_tags, vehicle_tags, ground_tags):
        errors.append("Tags may be too general or overly specific")

    return errors
```

### Quality Metrics
```
COVERAGE: Percentage of instances with comprehensive tagging across all dimensions
CONSISTENCY: Similar instances receive similar tag patterns
PRECISION: Tags accurately reflect figurative meaning
COMPLETENESS: No significant aspects left untagged
POSTURE_IDENTIFICATION: Speaker stance clearly identified in 95%+ of instances
```
