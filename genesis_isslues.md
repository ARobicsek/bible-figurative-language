- **וּבָרוּךְ֙ אֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן (And blessed be God Most High):** I considered whether the epithet ""Most High"" (`עֶלְיוֹן`) is figurative. It uses a physical, spatial concept (height) to describe God's supreme status and power. While technically metaphorical in origin, it functions as a conventionalized title or divine epithet. Under the ""CONSERVATIVE"" guideline, this is treated as standard divine nomenclature rather than an active, creative metaphor intended to be analyzed as such. Therefore, I have excluded it.
- **אֲשֶׁר־מִגֵּ֥ן צָרֶ֖יךָ בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ (Who has delivered your foes into your hand):** I analyzed the phrase ""into your hand"" (`בְּיָדֶךָ`). This is a clear candidate for figurative language. The enemies were not literally placed into Abram's physical hand. The ""hand"" (`יָד`) is a physical body part used to represent an abstract concept. This is a classic case of metonymy, where the instrument (the hand, which exerts power) stands for the abstract result (power, control, authority, possession). This phrase has also become a standard Hebrew idiom for complete victory or control over an opponent. This fits the criteria of marking physical concepts applied to abstract ones.

- **Phrase/Concept 1: וַיַּ֥עַל מֵעָלָ֖יו אֱלֹהִ֑ים (vaya'al me'alav Elohim) - ""God went up from him""**
- **Consideration:** I considered whether this phrase is a metaphor or simply a standard divine anthropomorphism. The verb `עלה` (`alah`, ""to go up"" or ""to ascend"") is a verb of physical motion. It is applied to God, who is understood as a non-corporeal, spiritual being.
- **Reasoning for Inclusion:** The instructions specify to ""MARK physical verbs applied to spiritual/abstract concepts."" This phrase fits that criterion perfectly. The abstract/spiritual concept is the departure of the divine presence or the conclusion of a theophany. This concept is described using the concrete, physical action of ""ascending."" While this is a form of anthropomorphism, it is not merely a conventional narrative device like ""God said."" It's a specific, vivid, spatial description of a non-spatial event. It functions as a conceptual metaphor where the spiritual event (WITHDRAWAL OF PRESENCE) is understood in terms of a physical action (ASCENDING). Therefore, it qualifies as figurative language under the given rules.
- **Borderline Cases:** This is a borderline case because of the instruction to ""BE CONSERVATIVE with... divine anthropomorphisms."" In the narrative world of Genesis, God is often depicted with physical attributes and actions. However, the instruction to specifically mark physical verbs for abstract concepts overrides the general caution in this instance, as it is a more specific rule that directly applies to this verb choice.

- **Phrase 1: ""וְעֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ מִזֹּ֔קֶן"" (Now Israel’s eyes were dim with age)**
- **Consideration:** I considered whether the verb ""כָּבְד֣וּ"" (*kavdu*), meaning ""were heavy,"" is used literally or figuratively.
- **Reasoning:** Eyes do not literally gain physical weight as they fail due to old age. The term ""heavy"" is used here to describe the *effect* or *sensation* of failing sight—a sluggishness, a difficulty in keeping them open or focusing, or a general impairment of function. This is a classic example of a physical attribute (weight) being used to describe a state of being or a functional decline. It is a metaphor, albeit a very common one that is close to being a dead metaphor or an idiom. However, based on the instruction to mark physical verbs/concepts applied to describe a state, this qualifies. It's not a literal description of the eyes' mass.
- **Conclusion:** I will include this as a metaphor.
- **Phrase 2: ""לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִרְא֑וֹת"" (he could not see)**
- **Consideration:** I checked if this phrase contained any figurative elements.
- **Reasoning:** This is a straightforward, literal statement of fact that clarifies the preceding metaphorical description. It describes Jacob's physical condition without any figurative language.
- **Conclusion:** I will exclude this.

- **Phrase 1: ""דָּנַנִּי אֱלֹהִים"" (God has vindicated me)**
- **Considered:** Metaphor; physical/social verb applied to a spiritual/abstract concept.
- **Reasoning for inclusion:** The Hebrew root `דִּין` (d-y-n) means ""to judge,"" ""to plead a case,"" or ""to vindicate."" This is language from the social and legal domain of a courtroom. Rachel is not literally in a court, and God is not a human judge sitting on a bench. She is using this legal concept metaphorically to describe God's intervention in her personal struggle for children. God is portrayed *as if* He were a judge who heard her case against her barrenness (or in her rivalry with Leah) and passed a favorable sentence. This fits the criteria of a metaphor and specifically a physical/social action being applied to a divine/abstract concept.
- **Borderline cases:** None. This is a clear example of a conceptual metaphor (DIVINE INTERVENTION IS A LEGAL JUDGMENT).

- **Overall Assessment:** The verse is a straightforward, declarative narrative statement introducing two characters. It functions as exposition, providing factual information necessary for the subsequent story. The language is literal and descriptive.
- **Phrase 1: `וּלְלָבָ֖ן שְׁתֵּ֣י בָנ֑וֹת` (Now Laban had two daughters):** I considered if this could be figurative in any way. It is a standard possessive construction in Hebrew, stating a literal fact within the narrative: Laban was the father of two female children. There is no figurative element here.
- **Phrase 2: `שֵׁ֤ם` (name):** I considered if ""name"" (`שֵׁם`) is used as a metonymy for character, essence, or reputation, as it can be elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., ""to make a great name for oneself"").
