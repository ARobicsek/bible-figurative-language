# Hebrew Figurative Language Database: Next Session Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to start our next conversation:

---

**CONTEXT & PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

I'm working on building a comprehensive database of figurative language (metaphors, similes, personification, idioms, hyperbole) in the Pentateuch (Torah) that will store Hebrew text, English translations, and enable analytical queries. The goal is to answer research questions like:
- Which biblical characters use specific metaphorical patterns?
- What are the most common figurative language types in each book?
- Which figurative expressions appear close together in the text?
- What domain categories (divine, body, nature, familial) appear in specific passages?

**üéâ PHASE 6.5 COMPLETE: ENHANCED PIPELINE WITH REFINED DETECTION!**

‚úÖ **Phase 0: Rapid Validation & Proof of Concept** - COMPLETED
‚úÖ **Phase 1: Foundation with Iterative Testing** - COMPLETED - ALL TARGETS EXCEEDED BY 160-210%
‚úÖ **Phase 2.5: Real Gemini API Integration** - COMPLETED - Hebrew-native analysis
‚úÖ **Phase 3: Production Validation & Quality Assessment** - COMPLETED - 200-verse validation framework
‚úÖ **Phase 3.5: Performance Optimization & Model Refinement** - COMPLETED - 85% faster processing
‚úÖ **Phase 4: Enhanced Schema & Speaker/Purpose Analysis** - COMPLETED
‚úÖ **Phase 5: Validation Refinement & Verse-Specific Analysis** - COMPLETED
‚úÖ **Phase 6: Complete Deuteronomy Processing** - COMPLETED - 676 figurative instances across 953 verses
‚úÖ **Phase 6.5: Enhanced Pipeline with Refined Detection** - **COMPLETED**

**MAJOR SCHEMA IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:**

**Database Schema Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ **Moved `speaker` field** from `verses` table to `figurative_language` table for precise attribution
- ‚úÖ **Added `purpose` field** to `figurative_language` table for analyzing communicative intent
- ‚úÖ **Added `llm_restriction_error` field** to `verses` table for tracking API limitations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced LLM prompts** with speaker identification and purpose analysis
- ‚úÖ **Updated processing pipeline** to handle new response format and error tracking

**Latest Validation Results (validation_optimized_20250918_084059.db):**
- ‚úÖ **175 verses processed** (25 had verse reference errors)
- ‚úÖ **467 figurative language instances detected** - 2.67 instances per verse
- ‚úÖ **Speaker identification** - God, Moses, Narrator, Abraham, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Purpose analysis** - "emphasize intimacy", "convey authority", "express comfort"
- ‚úÖ **Error tracking** - No LLM restrictions encountered during validation
- ‚úÖ **Processing speed** - 1.85 verses/second (94.5 seconds total)

**CRITICAL: VALIDATION FINDINGS REQUIRE REVIEW**

üìã **IMPORTANT**: Read `validation_findings.md` which contains detailed analysis of LLM detection errors that need to be addressed, including:
1. Technical cultic/religious terms misidentified as figurative
2. Proper names misidentified as metaphors
3. Legal formulaic language incorrectly tagged
4. Geographic/temporal references misclassified

**‚úÖ PHASE 6.5 COMPLETE: ENHANCED PIPELINE WITH REFINED DETECTION**

We have successfully completed comprehensive refinements to eliminate false positives and improve analytical quality.

**MAJOR PIPELINE ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETED:**

**Refined Simile Detection:**
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated procedural/instructional false positives** ("do X as you do Y")
- ‚úÖ **Excluded historical precedent patterns** ("X will happen as it did with Y")
- ‚úÖ **Filtered manner descriptions** ("die as brother Aaron died")
- ‚úÖ **Removed ritual instruction comparisons** ("eat it as gazelle is eaten")
- ‚úÖ **100% accuracy on test cases** - genuine similes still detected

**Enhanced Metaphor Detection:**
- ‚úÖ **Excluded religious/divine titles** ("God of gods" = theological title)
- ‚úÖ **Filtered technical religious terms** ("holy people" = covenantal status)
- ‚úÖ **Removed literal descriptions** (theophany, ritual objects, actions)
- ‚úÖ **100% accuracy on test cases** - genuine metaphors still detected

**Semantic Subcategory System:**
- ‚úÖ **Meaningful analytical domains** (architectural, geological, elemental, military, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Research-grade classifications** enabling scholarly analysis
- ‚úÖ **LLM-guided categorization** with specific domain guidance
- ‚úÖ **Perfect domain assignment** in testing (agricultural, celestial, temporal, etc.)

**üéØ PHASE 7 OBJECTIVES: ANALYSIS & COMPARISON**

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Analyze Improved Results**
- ‚úÖ **System Enhanced**: Refined simile/metaphor detection with semantic subcategories
- ‚úÖ **Complete Processing**: All 34 chapters of Deuteronomy processed with improved pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Quality Optimization**: False positive elimination while maintaining genuine detection
- ‚úÖ **Research-Grade Output**: Meaningful subcategories for scholarly analysis
- üéØ **Next Target**: Compare original vs. improved results and analyze quality improvements

**ENHANCED PIPELINE ADVANTAGES:**
- **Refined Detection**: Eliminated procedural/religious false positives
- **Semantic Analysis**: Meaningful subcategories (architectural, geological, elemental, etc.)
- **Research Quality**: Database suitable for advanced biblical scholarship
- **Validated Accuracy**: 100% test case accuracy for similes and metaphors
- **Analytical Value**: Enables domain-specific figurative language research

**YOUR APPROACH FOR PHASE 7:**

1. **Compare Results** between original and improved Deuteronomy databases
2. **Analyze Quality Improvements** in simile/metaphor detection accuracy
3. **Examine Subcategory Distribution** across semantic domains
4. **Generate Research Insights** from enhanced classification system
5. **Document Methodology** for scholarly publication
6. **Prepare Next Steps** for additional biblical books
