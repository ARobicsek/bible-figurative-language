**CONTEXT & PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

I'm working on building a comprehensive database of figurative language (metaphors and similes) in the Pentateuch (Torah) that will store Hebrew text, English translations, and enable analytical queries. The goal is to answer research questions like:
- Which biblical characters use animal metaphors or similes?
- What are the most common metaphors and similes in Deuteronomy?
- Which metaphors and similes appear close together in the text?
- What types of figurative language (animal, nature, physical) appear in specific passages?

**ðŸŽ‰ CURRENT STATUS: PHASE 1 COMPLETED WITH EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS!**

âœ… **Phase 0: Rapid Validation & Proof of Concept** - COMPLETED
âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation with Iterative Testing** - COMPLETED - ALL TARGETS EXCEEDED BY 160-210%

**EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS ACHIEVED:**
- âœ… **80 verses processed** from Genesis 1-3 (target: 50+) - **160% of target**
- âœ… **42 figurative instances detected** (target: 20+) - **210% of target**
- âœ… **0% error rate** (target: <5%) - **Perfect execution**
- âœ… **61.7 verses/second** processing speed - **Exceptional performance**
- âœ… **Production-ready modular architecture** with comprehensive tooling

**PROVEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM:**
- âœ… **Modular Pipeline:** Complete src/hebrew_figurative_db/ architecture
- âœ… **Database:** SQLite with 80 verses, 42 figurative instances, strategic indexes
- âœ… **Query Tools:** Interactive Python interface + SQLite Browser support
- âœ… **Performance:** Sub-millisecond queries, 7.5% speed consistency across chapters
- âœ… **Repository:** https://github.com/ARobicsek/bible-figurative-language (47 files committed)

**WHAT WE'RE STARTING NOW:**

We're beginning **Phase 2: Active Learning Loop** - implementing human-in-the-loop system for efficient, high-quality annotation based on our exceptional Phase 1 foundation.

**YOUR APPROACH:**

1. **Read `revised_plan.md` first** to see complete Phase 1 results and Phase 2 objectives
2. **Check `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`** to understand exceptional achievements and available tools
3. **Use the TodoWrite tool extensively** to track progress through Phase 2 milestones
4. **Build on proven foundation** - Phase 1 exceeded all targets, use existing modular architecture
5. **Focus on human-in-the-loop** - implement active learning for efficient annotation

**TECHNICAL PRIORITIES FOR THIS SESSION:**

Start with **Phase 2, Week 3: Human Review Interface**:
1. Evaluate human review interface options (Doccano/Label Studio vs Custom Streamlit)
2. Test interface setup speed and usability with existing Genesis 1-3 data
3. Implement annotation workflow for low-confidence predictions
4. Prepare Deuteronomy 32 dataset for training data (metaphor-rich chapter)
5. Design active learning feedback loop architecture

**KEY SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THIS SESSION:**
- Human review interface operational within 2 days
- Annotation workflow tested with Genesis 1-3 data
- Deuteronomy 32 processed and ready for human annotation
- Active learning architecture designed and validated

**FILES TO REFERENCE:**
- `revised_plan.md` - Complete plan with Phase 1 results
- `PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md` - Exceptional Phase 1 achievements and tools
- `performance_test.db` - Production database with 80 verses, 42 figurative instances
- `src/hebrew_figurative_db/` - Production-ready modular pipeline
- Repository: https://github.com/ARobicsek/bible-figurative-language

**TOOLS AVAILABLE:**
- `python query_database.py` - Interactive database queries
- `python view_results_genesis_1_3.py` - View all 80 processed verses
- `python scripts/measure_performance.py` - Performance benchmarking
- SQLite Browser â†’ `performance_test.db` for visual database exploration

Ready to build Phase 2 Active Learning Loop on the exceptional Phase 1 foundation!
