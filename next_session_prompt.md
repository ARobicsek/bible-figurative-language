Copy and paste this prompt to start our next conversation:

---

**CONTEXT & PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

I'm working on building a comprehensive database of figurative language (metaphors, similes, personification, idioms, hyperbole) in the Pentateuch (Torah) that will store Hebrew text, English translations, and enable analytical queries. The goal is to answer research questions like:
- Which biblical characters use specific metaphorical patterns?
- What are the most common figurative language types in each book?
- Which figurative expressions appear close together in the text?
- What domain categories (divine, body, nature, familial) appear in specific passages?

**🎉 PRODUCTION-READY VALIDATION SYSTEM ACHIEVED!**

- ✅ **Speaker detection** - Enhanced LLM prompts identify "God", "Moses", "Narrator"
- ✅ **API optimization** - Reduced delays from 500ms to 100ms between requests
- ✅ **Quality improvements** - Genesis 15:5 now correctly detects 3 figurative instances
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** - Live progress tracking with performance metrics

**PROVEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM:**
- ✅ **LLM-Only Pipeline:** Real Gemini 1.5 Flash API (optimized for biblical content, no rule-based fallback needed)
- ✅ **Production Database:** Support for Hebrew + English figurative text, detailed explanations
- ✅ **Hebrew Processing:** Diacritic removal, speaker detection utilities
- ✅ **Multi-Instance Detection:** Multiple database rows per verse when multiple types found
- ✅ **Research Quality:** Explanations like "Heart and soul represent totality of one's being"
- ✅ **Validation Framework:** 200-verse random sampling with manual review tools

**WHAT WE'RE READY FOR NOW:**

With Phase 3 validation complete, we're ready for **Phase 4: Scale & Research Applications** - full-scale biblical processing and advanced research capabilities.

**IMMEDIATE OPTIONS:**

**Option 1: Full Book Processing** - Scale validated system to complete biblical books
**Option 2: Manual Validation Review** - Analyze 200-verse validation results for quality assessment
**Option 3: Advanced Research Analytics** - Build query capabilities on existing validated data
**Option 4: Scholarly Export Tools** - Create publication-ready research outputs

**YOUR APPROACH:**

1. **Read `revised_plan.md` first** to see complete Phase 3 validation results
2. **Check validation databases** to understand the quality and scope of analysis
3. **Use the TodoWrite tool extensively** to track progress through chosen phase
4. **Leverage production system** - We now have validated Hebrew-native scholarly analysis
5. **Focus on research applications** - The validation framework is complete, ready for scale or analysis

**RECOMMENDED TECHNICAL PRIORITIES:**

**Option 1: Manual Validation Review** (Recommended for Quality):
1. Use query_non_figurative_verses.sql to find verses without figurative language
2. Manually review sample of detected vs non-detected verses for accuracy
3. Identify systematic patterns in false positives/negatives
4. Document LLM performance characteristics for scholarly use
5. Create quality assessment report for research publication

**Option 2: Scale to Full Books**:
1. Process complete Genesis using validated individual verse system
2. Monitor API usage and optimize for large-scale processing
3. Build batch processing capabilities for efficient book-level analysis
4. Create comprehensive biblical figurative language database
5. Implement progress tracking and resumption capabilities

**Option 3: Advanced Research Analytics**:
1. Implement proximity analysis queries (figurative language within N verses)
2. Build character-specific metaphor pattern analysis using existing data
3. Create domain categorization analytics (divine, body, nature, familial)
4. Develop co-occurrence mapping of metaphorical concepts
5. Export capabilities for external research tools (Excel, CSV, JSON)

**KEY SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Complete book processed with LLM analysis OR advanced analytics operational
- Research-quality results suitable for biblical scholarship
- Performance monitoring and optimization implemented
