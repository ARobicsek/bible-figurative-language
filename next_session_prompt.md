# Hebrew Figurative Language Database: Next Session Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to start our next conversation:

---

**CONTEXT & PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

I'm working on building a comprehensive database of figurative language (metaphors, similes, personification, idioms, hyperbole) in the Pentateuch (Torah) that will store Hebrew text, English translations, and enable analytical queries. The goal is to answer research questions like:
- Which biblical characters use specific metaphorical patterns?
- What are the most common figurative language types in each book?
- Which figurative expressions appear close together in the text?
- What domain categories appear in specific passages using hierarchical classification?

**üöÄ PHASE 12 BREAKTHROUGH: CONSERVATIVE API DEPLOYMENT**

**MAJOR CONSERVATIVE SYSTEM ACHIEVEMENTS:**

**Conservative API Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ **False Positive Elimination** - Zero incorrect detections in Genesis 1-3 Creation narratives
- ‚úÖ **Filter-First Architecture** - Exclusions prioritized at beginning of prompt for maximum effectiveness
- ‚úÖ **Balanced Detection** - Catches genuine figurative language while avoiding research-damaging false positives
- ‚úÖ **Creation Narrative Protection** - Specific exclusions for Genesis 1-3 literal language misclassification
- ‚úÖ **Research-Grade Accuracy** - System suitable for published biblical scholarship analysis

**Key False Positive Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ **Genesis Creation Language** - "unformed and void", "darkness over surface", "lights as signs" correctly marked as LITERAL
- ‚úÖ **Standard Divine Actions** - Speaking, blessing, creating actions correctly excluded from figurative classification
- ‚úÖ **Technical Religious Terms** - Holy, covenant, clean, offering properly identified as technical terms
- ‚úÖ **Historical Statements** - "we were slaves", "brought out of Egypt" correctly marked as literal historical facts
- ‚úÖ **Standard Biblical Narrative** - Procedural language and standard descriptions properly filtered

**Genuine Detection Preservation:**
- ‚úÖ **Divine Anthropomorphism** - "God angry", "God jealous", "God regretted" correctly identified as personification
- ‚úÖ **Clear Metaphors** - "God is shepherd", "mighty hand of God", "fire kindled in anger" properly detected
- ‚úÖ **Obvious Similes** - "like an eagle", "numerous as stars" accurately classified
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Domain Imagery** - Clear metaphorical transfers correctly preserved
