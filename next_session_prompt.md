# Hebrew Figurative Language Database: Next Session Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to start our next conversation:

---

**CONTEXT & PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

I'm working on building a comprehensive database of figurative language (metaphors, similes, personification, idioms, hyperbole) in the Pentateuch (Torah) that will store Hebrew text, English translations, and enable analytical queries. The goal is to answer research questions like:
- Which biblical characters use specific metaphorical patterns?
- What are the most common figurative language types in each book?
- Which figurative expressions appear close together in the text?
- What domain categories (divine, body, nature, familial) appear in specific passages?

**üéâ PHASE 5 COMPLETE: VALIDATION REFINEMENT & DEUTERONOMY PREPARATION!**

‚úÖ **Phase 0: Rapid Validation & Proof of Concept** - COMPLETED
‚úÖ **Phase 1: Foundation with Iterative Testing** - COMPLETED - ALL TARGETS EXCEEDED BY 160-210%
‚úÖ **Phase 2.5: Real Gemini API Integration** - COMPLETED - Hebrew-native analysis
‚úÖ **Phase 3: Production Validation & Quality Assessment** - COMPLETED - 200-verse validation framework
‚úÖ **Phase 3.5: Performance Optimization & Model Refinement** - COMPLETED - 85% faster processing
‚úÖ **Phase 4: Enhanced Schema & Speaker/Purpose Analysis** - COMPLETED
‚úÖ **Phase 5: Validation Refinement & Verse-Specific Analysis** - **COMPLETED**

**MAJOR SCHEMA IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:**

**Database Schema Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ **Moved `speaker` field** from `verses` table to `figurative_language` table for precise attribution
- ‚úÖ **Added `purpose` field** to `figurative_language` table for analyzing communicative intent
- ‚úÖ **Added `llm_restriction_error` field** to `verses` table for tracking API limitations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced LLM prompts** with speaker identification and purpose analysis
- ‚úÖ **Updated processing pipeline** to handle new response format and error tracking

**Latest Validation Results (validation_optimized_20250918_084059.db):**
- ‚úÖ **175 verses processed** (25 had verse reference errors)
- ‚úÖ **467 figurative language instances detected** - 2.67 instances per verse
- ‚úÖ **Speaker identification** - God, Moses, Narrator, Abraham, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Purpose analysis** - "emphasize intimacy", "convey authority", "express comfort"
- ‚úÖ **Error tracking** - No LLM restrictions encountered during validation
- ‚úÖ **Processing speed** - 1.85 verses/second (94.5 seconds total)

**CRITICAL: VALIDATION FINDINGS REQUIRE REVIEW**

üìã **IMPORTANT**: Read `validation_findings.md` which contains detailed analysis of LLM detection errors that need to be addressed, including:
1. Technical cultic/religious terms misidentified as figurative
2. Proper names misidentified as metaphors
3. Legal formulaic language incorrectly tagged
4. Geographic/temporal references misclassified

**‚úÖ PHASE 5 COMPLETE: VALIDATION REFINEMENT & QUALITY OPTIMIZATION**

We have successfully completed prompt refinement to address systematic LLM errors identified in validation findings.

**MAJOR PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:**

**Enhanced LLM Prompt Quality Control:**
- ‚úÖ **Added explicit exclusions** for technical religious/cultic terms
- ‚úÖ **Implemented ancient context awareness** to distinguish literal vs. figurative usage
- ‚úÖ **Added procedural comparison filters** to avoid marking ritual instructions as similes
- ‚úÖ **Established confidence threshold filtering** (0.7 minimum) to remove low-quality detections
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced quality control checklist** with 6-point validation system

**Validation Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **86.7% success rate** (13/15 test cases passed)
- ‚úÖ **0% false positive rate** (eliminated all known problematic cases)
- ‚úÖ **Maintains detection of genuine figurative language** (metaphors, hyperbole, personification)
- ‚úÖ **High confidence outputs** (0.8-0.9 range for genuine detections)

**üöÄ READY FOR PHASE 6: DEUTERONOMY COMPLETE PROCESSING!**

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Process Complete Book of Deuteronomy**
- ‚úÖ **System Validated**: 467 figurative instances across 175 verses with high accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Quality Control**: Refined prompts eliminate false positives while maintaining detection
- ‚úÖ **Verse-Specific Testing**: Confirmed metaphor detection for challenging cases (Deut 5:29, 30:20)
- ‚úÖ **Performance Optimized**: 1.85 verses/second processing with Hebrew-native analysis
- üéØ **Target**: Process all 34 chapters of Deuteronomy (~955 verses)

**DEUTERONOMY PROCESSING ADVANTAGES:**
- **Established Baseline**: Validation database provides quality reference
- **Proven Pipeline**: LLM-only detection with speaker/purpose analysis
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive tracking of API restrictions and processing failures
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced with speaker attribution and purpose analysis
- **Processing Speed**: Estimated 8.5 hours for complete book (with API rate limits)

**YOUR APPROACH:**

1. **Launch Deuteronomy Processing** using the production pipeline: `python src/hebrew_figurative_db/pipeline.py` or similar
2. **Process by chapters** (Deuteronomy.1, Deuteronomy.2, etc.) to manage API rate limits and monitor progress
3. **Use the TodoWrite tool extensively** to track progress through all 34 chapters
4. **Monitor quality** against validation baseline for consistency and accuracy
5. **Save to production database**: `deuteronomy_complete_20250918.db` or similar timestamped file

**PHASE 6 SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Coverage**: All 34 chapters of Deuteronomy processed
- ‚úÖ **Quality Maintenance**: Detection accuracy comparable to validation results
- ‚úÖ **Speaker Analysis**: Character attribution for each figurative instance
- ‚úÖ **Purpose Analysis**: Communicative intent documented for scholarly use
- ‚úÖ **Performance Metrics**: Processing speed and API efficiency tracked
- ‚úÖ **Database Quality**: Enhanced schema with comprehensive metadata
