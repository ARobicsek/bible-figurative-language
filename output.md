I examined each phrase for potential figurative language, considering metaphors, metonymies, and personification.\n\n1. **"wisdom and discernment" (חׇכְמַתְכֶם וּבִינַתְכֶם):** I considered whether t         this could be a metonymy, where the faithful observance of the law stands *for* wisdom and discernment. However, this is a direct description of the outcome of obedience, not a figurative substitution.  Therefore, it\'s not figurative.\n\n2. **"a great nation" (הגּוֹי הַגָּדוֹל):**  The term "great nation" could be considered hyperbole, implying a nation ex     xceeding typical size or influence. However, the context suggests a literal description of a large and powerful nation, not an exaggeration.  Therefore, it\'s not figurative.\n\n3. **"wise and discerning people" (עם חכם ונבון):** Similar to the previous point, this is a direct description, not a figurative comparison.  It\'s a literal assessment of the nation\'s character based on their actions.  Therefore, it\'s not figurative.\n\n4. **The entire sentence structure:** I considered whether the entire sentence, describing the other nations\' perception of Israel, could be interpreted as a metaphor.  However, it\'s a straightforward statement of cause and effect: obedience leads to a positive reputation.  There\'s no implicit comparison to another domain. Therefore, it\'s not figurative.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 0, 'instances_recovered': 0, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': True, 'fallback_reason': 'server error'}

However, rhetorical questions are primarily a literary device for emphasis rather than a type of figurative language like metaphor or simile. The phrase "great nation" is descriptive. The overall statement is a comparison of function/role (no other nation has a god *like* YHWH in this specific aspect), which the instructions explicitly state not to mark as figurative. Therefore, I have excluded it.\n\n2.  **אֱלֹהִ֖ים קְרֹבִ֣ים אֵלָ֑יו / a god so close at hand**: I considered this phrase for metaphor, anthropomorphism, and idiom.\n    *   **Anthropomorphism**: While "closeness" can            be seen as a human attribute, the instructions specify that divine anthropomorphisms are literal unless they refer to God\'s body. "Close" here refers to God\'s presence and accessibility, not a physical body part. However, for an incorporeal being, "closeness" cannot be understood in a literal, physical sense.\n    *   **Metaphor**: The concept of "closeness" (קָרוֹב) when applied to God is a clear cross-domain comparison. The physical proximity (vehicle) is used to describe God\'s relational and spiritual accessibility, responsiv veness, and intimate presence to His people (tenor). God is not physically "close" in the way two objects are close; rather, He is relationally and spiritually available and attentive. This is a direct mapping from the physical domain to the relational/spiritual domain.\n    *   **Idiom**: While "close at hand" is a common English idiom, the Hebrew phrase קְרֹבִ֣ים אֵלָ֑יו (qrovim elav) literally means "close to him." The figurative nature arises from the metaphorical application of "close" to God\'s character, rather than from a fi      ixed idiomatic phrase with a non-literal meaning.\n    *   Based on this reasoning, I have included this phrase as a metaphor.\n\n3.  **כַּיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֔ינוּ / as is our God יהוה*         **: I considered this as a potential simile due to the comparative particle "כַּ" (as/like). However, the instructions explicitly state: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Comparisons of r role or function, such as \'a prophet like myself\' (כָּמֹנִי) or \'a prophet like yourself\' (כָּמוֹךָ). These are literal statements of equivalence or similarity in function, not       t figurative similes." This phrase compares YHWH\'s unique function and nature (His unparalleled closeness/accessibility) to other gods. It is a statement of unique equivalence in function, not a figurative simile. Therefore, I have excluded it.\n\n```json', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}

My reasoning for excluding it is that "great" can be a literal      l descriptor for a nation\'s size, power, or influence, and is not necessarily an exaggeration for rhetorical effect in this context. It\'s a straightforward descriptive adjective.\n\n2.  **"חֻקִּ֥ים וּמִשְׁפָּטִ֖ים צַדִּיקִ֑ם" (righteous statutes and judgments / perfect laws and rules):** I considered if "righteous" or "perfect" when applied to laws could                  be personification or metaphor. My reasoning for excluding it is that "righteous" (צַדִּיקִם) here describes the moral quality or justice inherent in the laws themselves, from the   e speaker\'s perspective. It\'s a literal characterization of their ethical standard, not an attribution of human characteristics to an inanimate object.\n\n3.  **"כְּכֹל֙ הַתּוֹרָ       ה הַזֹּ֔את" (as all this Teaching):** I considered if this comparison, introduced by כְּ (as/like), constitutes a simile. My reasoning for excluding it is based on the explicit i      instruction: "NEVER MARK AS FIGURATIVE: Proportional or behavioral comparisons, such as \'according to the blessing\' or \'like all his fellow Levites\'." This comparison directly relates the quality (righteousness/perfection) of other nations\' laws to the quality of "this Teaching." It is a direct comparison of attributes or a statement of equivalence in quality, not a cross-domain figurative simile.\n\n4.  **"נֹתֵ֥ן לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם" (I set before you / I give before your faces):** I considered if this phrase is an idiom. My reasoning       g for including it is that "נֹתֵן לִפְנֵי" (to give/set before the face of) is a common biblical Hebrew idiom. In the context of presenting laws or a covenant, it means "to present    t to," "to declare to," or "to make known to," rather than a literal physical act of placing an object directly in front of someone\'s face. This fits the definition of a biblical idiom as a set phrase whose meaning goes beyond the literal sum of its parts in this specific context.', 'truncation_info': {'instances_detected': 1, 'instances_recovered': 1, 'instances_lost_to_truncation': 0, 'truncation_occurred': 'no'}, 'fallback_used': False}
