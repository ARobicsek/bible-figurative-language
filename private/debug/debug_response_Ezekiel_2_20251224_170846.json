    "deliberation": "Assessed whether the description of the scroll 'written on both the front and the back' and the triad 'lamentations, dirges, and woes' involve merism, hyperbole, or metaphor. The double-sided writing underscores fullness but is simply a physical description of the scroll; the listed terms denote types of lament without transferring meaning from another domain. The verse is vivid but not overtly figurative in the technical sense requested.",
