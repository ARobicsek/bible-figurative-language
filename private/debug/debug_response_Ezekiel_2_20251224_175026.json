The fullness of writing has symbolic significance for later interpretation, but the wording itself is descriptive rather than figurative (no explicit metaphor, simile, or idiom). The triplet names genres of judgment oracles, not metaphorical designations here, so I treated the verse as lacking a discrete figurative expression under the specified categories.",
