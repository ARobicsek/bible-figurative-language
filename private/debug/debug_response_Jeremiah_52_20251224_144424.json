          "raising the head parallels elevating someone from shame/low status to honor and freedom",

The phrase 'ate bread before him' likely reflects an actual arrangement of regular table-privilege; 'bread' here may function as a mild synecdoche for food, but the verse primarily reports literal provision. I treat it as effectively literal.",
