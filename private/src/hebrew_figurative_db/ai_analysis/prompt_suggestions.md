Based on the provided output for Genesis 1-3, your tool has correctly identified some instances of figurative language but has also made several errors. The most common mistakes are false positives, where it labels literal descriptions, theological concepts, or standard biblical language as figurative.

The tool also misses some genuine instances and struggles with the precise classification of certain phrases, particularly in the distinction between metaphor and personification. The provided metaphor_validator.py and gemini_api.py files reveal that the system has a solid foundation, including a two-stage validation process and a detailed prompt, but the prompt itself appears to be the source of many of these errors.

Detected Errors
❌ False Positives
The most significant issue is the over-detection of figurative language. The tool incorrectly identifies many literal and theological terms as metaphors or personifications, despite the gemini_api.py prompt's explicit warnings against this.

unformed and void (Genesis 1:2): The prompt correctly defines "unformed and void" (תֹ֙הוּ֙וָבֹ֔הוּ) as a literal description of the earth's state before creation. It is not a metaphor for chaos.

darkness over the surface of the deep (Genesis 1:2): This is a literal, factual description of the primordial state of the world in the biblical narrative, not a metaphor for a chaotic state.

lights and as signs for the set times (Genesis 1:14): The prompt explicitly warns against treating straightforward descriptions as figurative. These are literal descriptions of the function of the sun, moon, and stars, which were indeed created as markers for days, years, and seasons. They are not metaphorical.

a flow would well up from the ground (Genesis 2:6): The tool's own prompt (gemini_api.py) explicitly states that "literal actions...that actually occur in the text" should not be marked as figurative. This is a literal description of how the garden was watered.

a living being and breath of life (Genesis 2:7): While "breath of life" is a profound theological concept, the tool's prompt correctly categorizes "divine actions" like this as not metaphorical. The phrase "a living being" (נֶ֣פֶשׁחַיָּֽה) is a technical term for a living creature, not a metaphor. The same goes for dust you are, and to dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19), which is a literal theological statement about human mortality.

the lesser light to dominate the night (Genesis 1:16): The verb "dominate" (לְמֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת) is a literal description of the moon's function to rule the night sky. The prompt itself should prevent this classification.

The earth brought forth (Genesis 1:12, 1:24) and the fiery ever-turning sword (Genesis 3:24): These are cases where the tool incorrectly labels personification. While the actions are non-human, the gemini_api.py prompt warns against labeling such "natural phenomena with divine cause" or "standard biblical actions" as figurative. The earth's "bringing forth" and the sword's "turning" are part of the literal, miraculous act of creation and divine judgment. The prompt's examples of genuine personification are more active and human-like, such as a land "vomiting" its inhabitants, which is not the case here.

⚠️ Inaccurate Classifications
The tool sometimes correctly identifies a figurative passage but assigns the wrong type, category, or explanation.

the serpent duped me (Genesis 3:13): The tool marks this as personification, explaining that it represents the woman's "internal susceptibility to temptation." This is a significant misinterpretation. The serpent is a character in the narrative with literal agency; it literally duped the woman. The phrase is a straightforward statement of fact from the woman's perspective, not figurative language.

enmity (Genesis 3:15): The tool incorrectly labels this as a personification of enmity "as an active force." It's a literal description of the relationship God is establishing between humanity and the serpent, a state of hostility, not a personified entity.

a delight to the eyes (Genesis 3:6): The tool classifies this as a metaphor for "seductive power." This is not a metaphor but a straightforward description of the fruit's appealing appearance. The "seductive power" is an effect of the appeal, not the phrase itself.

shrewdest (Genesis 3:1): The tool labels this a metaphor because it gives the serpent "human-like intelligence." This is a better fit for personification, as it's attributing a human trait (shrewdness/cunning) to a non-human entity. The prompt should have guided the tool to this distinction, as it provides clear examples of divine personification.

Recommendations for Improvement
The core issue lies in the LLM's interpretation of the prompt's exclusion criteria. While the instructions are detailed, the LLM is failing to apply them consistently. The prompt is also too complex, leading to confusion between its instructions and the LLM's own general knowledge.

1. Simplify and Prioritize the Prompt
The current prompt is long and contains many complex sections. The LLM seems to get lost in the details and fails to apply the most important negative constraints.

Move "CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS" to the very beginning. Make it the first and most prominent section. Use a bold, all-caps heading and a clear, simple list of what not to do.

Consolidate and rephrase. Instead of many separate "DO NOT classify" lists, create a single, clear list of exclusion rules. Use bullet points and bold key terms. For example:

DO NOT classify standard divine actions (e.g., God spoke, God blessed, God created).

DO NOT classify literal historical or geographic statements (e.g., We were slaves, the land was unformed, the earth brought forth).

DO NOT classify technical or formulaic religious/legal terms.

DO NOT classify literal descriptions of physical objects or events.

A/B Test the prompt structure. Try a prompt that starts with the negative constraints first and then moves to the positive instructions. This "filter-first" approach may help the model avoid false positives from the outset.

2. Refine Metaphor vs. Personification Distinctions
The provided metaphor_validator.py and gemini_api.py files show an attempt to distinguish between these, but the LLM still misclassifies them.

Make the distinction even clearer. Add a new, prominent section in the prompt titled "METAPHOR vs. PERSONIFICATION."

Use simple, memorable rules. Explain the core difference concisely:

Metaphor: Compares two different kinds of things (e.g., God is a shepherd).

Personification: Gives human actions or qualities to a non-human thing (e.g., the land "spewed out" its inhabitants).

Reclassify examples in the prompt. Re-evaluate the examples in the gemini_api.py prompt. For example, God's hand, arm, finger are correctly marked as metaphors because God is incorporeal, and these are cross-domain comparisons. However, a phrase like the serpent was shrewdest should be a classic example of personification. The prompt should explicitly state this.

3. Incorporate Self-Correction
The metaphor_validator.py already implements a two-stage validation. This is an excellent feature, but the prompt for the validator itself could be improved to focus on correcting the types of errors seen here.

Give the validator a stronger, more focused prompt. The validation prompt is already good, but it could be even more direct. When a metaphor is detected, the validation prompt should specifically ask, "Is this a literal description, a theological term, a standard biblical action, or a genuine cross-domain comparison?"

Use the validator to catch the most common false positives. The tool should be configured to flag and re-evaluate any metaphor or personification found in the Creation story, given the high likelihood of false positives.

By simplifying the prompt's structure and making the negative constraints more prominent, you can significantly reduce the number of false positives and improve the tool's accuracy.
