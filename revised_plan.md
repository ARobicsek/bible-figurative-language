# Hebrew Figurative Language Database: Fail-Fast Implementation Plan

## Project Goal
Create a local database of all figurative language (metaphors and similes) in the Pentateuch with Hebrew text, English translations, and analytical capabilities for research queries about metaphor and simile patterns, character usage, and textual proximity.

## Core Philosophy: Fail-Fast with Early Validation

This plan prioritizes **rapid testing of core assumptions** before building complex systems. Each phase has clear success criteria and pivot points to avoid investing time in approaches that won't work.

---

## Phase 0: Rapid Validation & Proof of Concept (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Validate all core technologies work together before building anything complex.

### Day 1-2: Technology Stack Validation ✅
- **Test Text-Fabric Setup** ❌ → **PIVOTED** ✅
  - ❌ ETCBC data download failed (network/server issues)
  - ✅ **SUCCESSFUL PIVOT** to Sefaria API + simplified morphology
  - **Result:** Sefaria provides reliable Hebrew text with 0.47s response times

- **Test Sefaria API Integration** ✅
  - ✅ API access confirmed, no rate limiting issues
  - ✅ Retrieved Genesis 1:1-10 in Hebrew + English (JPS)
  - **Result:** 0.47s response time (well under 2s target)

- **Test AI Model Access** ✅
  - ✅ Claude 3.5 Sonnet working perfectly (100% accuracy on test cases)
  - ⚠️ BEREL available but not immediately needed
  - **Result:** Claude alone sufficient for Phase 1

### Day 3-4: Rule-Based Detection Validation ✅
- **Pattern Query Testing** ✅
  - ✅ Found 48 figurative patterns in Genesis 1-3:
    - Similes: 9 examples (English "like/as")
    - Personification: 33 examples (God performing human actions)
    - Metaphorical language: 6 examples (image, likeness, etc.)
  - **Result:** Far exceeded 5-10 target examples

- **Database Schema Testing** ✅
  - ✅ SQLite schema created and tested
  - ✅ Inserted test records from Genesis examples
  - ✅ Query performance: <1ms (well under 1s target)
  - **Result:** Database operations working smoothly

### Day 5-7: AI Integration Testing ✅
- **Prompt Engineering** ✅
  - ✅ Claude tested with known metaphor/simile examples
  - ✅ Achieved 100% accuracy (exceeded 80% target)
  - ✅ Perfect distinction between metaphors vs similes
  - ✅ Confidence scoring system implemented
  - **Result:** AI detection working excellently

- **End-to-End Test** ✅
  - ✅ **Genesis 1:1-10 processed completely:**
    - Hebrew extraction: 10 verses (0.47s API time)
    - AI analysis: 8 personification instances detected
    - Database storage: All records saved successfully
  - ✅ **Pipeline works without manual intervention**
  - **🎉 GO DECISION: Proceed to Phase 1**

---

## Phase 1: Foundation with Iterative Testing (Week 2)

**Goal:** Build minimal viable system with continuous validation.

### Core Infrastructure (Updated from Phase 0 Results)
- **Environment Setup:** Python venv, dependencies, Git repo
- **Data Pipeline:** Sefaria API integration (ETCBC pivot) with error handling
- **Database:** SQLite with validated schema from Phase 0 tests
- **AI Abstraction:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet primary (BEREL optional for later phases)

### Iterative Testing Approach
- **Day 1-2:** Build on Genesis 1 (1 chapter)
- **Day 3-4:** Expand to Genesis 1-3 (test scaling)
- **Day 5-7:** Process Deuteronomy 30 (metaphor-rich chapter for training data)

### Success Metrics for Phase 1
- Process 50+ verses automatically
- Identify 20+ figurative language instances
- <5% data processing errors
- Database queries execute in <1 second

**Pivot Point:** If processing speed is too slow or error rate >10%, simplify the data model before proceeding.

## Phase 2: Active Learning Loop (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** Implement human-in-the-loop system for efficient, high-quality annotation.

### Week 3: Human Review Interface
- **Technology Decision:** Test both approaches in parallel:
  - Option A: Existing tool (Doccano/Label Studio) - 2 days to set up and test
  - Option B: Custom Streamlit app - 2 days to build and test
- **Choose winner** based on setup speed and usability
- **Test Interface** with Deuteronomy 30 annotations

### Week 4-5: Active Learning Implementation
- **Model Training:** Fine-tune best available model (BEREL or Claude) on annotated Deuteronomy 30
- **Uncertainty Sampling:** Implement confidence threshold system
- **Feedback Loop:** Human reviews only low-confidence predictions
- **Test on Genesis:** Measure reduction in human review workload

### Week 6: Optimization & Validation
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Human review time per verse
  - Model accuracy improvement over iterations
  - Coverage: % of figurative language detected
- **Quality Control:** Inter-annotator agreement testing
- **Scale Test:** Process entire book (Genesis or Exodus)

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- Human review time reduced by 60%+ vs manual annotation
- Model accuracy >85% on test set
- Complete book processed in <8 hours human time

**Pivot Point:** If active learning doesn't reduce human effort significantly, fall back to rule-based + manual review.

## Phase 3: Scale & Analysis Engine (Weeks 7-8)

**Goal:** Complete Pentateuch processing and build analytical capabilities.

### Week 7: Full Pentateuch Processing
- **Automated Processing:** Apply trained model to remaining books
- **Quality Assurance:** Spot-check high/low confidence predictions
- **Database Population:** Complete figurative language database

### Week 8: Analysis & Query System
- **Query Development:**
  - Character-based metaphor patterns
  - Book-specific figurative language frequency
  - Proximity analysis (co-occurring metaphors)
  - Domain categorization (animal, nature, physical, etc.)
- **Visualization:** Basic charts and network graphs
- **Export Capabilities:** CSV/JSON for external analysis

---

## Technology Stack (Validated in Phase 0)

### Core Infrastructure
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Database:** SQLite with full-text search
- **Framework:** Text-Fabric for Hebrew processing
- **APIs:** Sefaria (Hebrew/English), Claude/Gemini

### AI Models (Priority Order)
1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (primary) - proven metaphor detection
2. **BEREL** (if accessible) - Hebrew-specific understanding
3. **Gemini Pro** (backup) - alternative LLM approach

### Data Sources (Updated from Phase 0 Results)
- **Hebrew Text:** Sefaria API (ETCBC pivot successful)
- **Translations:** Sefaria API (JPS validated, ESV/NRSV available)
- **Morphology:** Simplified word-level analysis (sufficient for figurative language detection)
- **Annotations:** Human expert review via active learning

## Risk Mitigation & Pivot Strategies

### High-Risk Assumptions & Mitigation (Updated from Phase 0 Results)
1. **BEREL Model Availability** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Result:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet sufficient, BEREL available if needed later
   - **Status:** Risk mitigated through successful Claude validation

2. **Text-Fabric Query Effectiveness** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Result:** ETCBC failed, successful pivot to Sefaria API
   - **Status:** Alternative approach proven effective

3. **Active Learning Efficiency**
   - **Risk:** Human-in-the-loop doesn't reduce annotation effort
   - **Mitigation:** Measure efficiency early, fall back to targeted manual annotation

4. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk:** Sefaria or AI APIs too restrictive for full Pentateuch
   - **Mitigation:** Test limits early, implement caching and batch processing

### Success Metrics & Go/No-Go Criteria

**Phase 0 Success:** All core technologies integrate successfully
**Phase 1 Success:** Process 3 chapters with <5% error rate
**Phase 2 Success:** Active learning reduces human effort by 60%+
**Phase 3 Success:** Complete database with query capabilities

## Resource Requirements

- **Time:** 8 weeks (2 weeks faster than original plan due to fail-fast approach)
- **Cost:** <$100 total (API usage, minimal compute)
- **Storage:** <500MB for complete database
- **Human Effort:** ~40 hours of expert annotation (vs 200+ hours for manual approach)

---

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Local SQLite Database** with complete Pentateuch figurative language
2. **Query Interface** for analytical research questions
3. **Documentation** of methodology and findings
4. **Exportable Dataset** for scholarly use
5. **Reusable Pipeline** for extending to other biblical texts

This fail-fast approach ensures we validate core assumptions early and build only what's proven to work, dramatically reducing risk while maintaining scholarly rigor.
