üö® **CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS - READ FIRST** üö®
**DO NOT MARK THE FOLLOWING AS FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE:**

**CREATION NARRATIVES (Genesis 1-3) - BE EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE:**
‚Ä¢ "unformed and void" (◊™÷π÷ô◊î◊ï÷º÷ô◊ï÷∏◊ë÷π÷î◊î◊ï÷º) = LITERAL primordial state description
‚Ä¢ "darkness over the surface of the deep" = LITERAL description of pre-creation
‚Ä¢ "lights" and "signs for set times" = LITERAL celestial function descriptions
‚Ä¢ "earth brought forth" = LITERAL creation action (NOT personification)
‚Ä¢ "breath of life" (◊†÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊û÷∑◊™ ◊ó÷∑◊ô÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù) = TECHNICAL theological term
‚Ä¢ "living being" (◊†÷∂◊§÷∂◊©◊Å ◊ó÷∑◊ô÷∏÷º◊î) = TECHNICAL term for living creature
‚Ä¢ "dominate/rule" celestial bodies = LITERAL functional descriptions
‚Ä¢ "flow/mist from ground" = LITERAL irrigation description
‚Ä¢ Divine creating, speaking, blessing = STANDARD creation actions

**NEVER CLASSIFY AS FIGURATIVE:**
‚Ä¢ Divine standard actions: God spoke, blessed, created, made, saw, heard
‚Ä¢ Technical religious terms: holy, clean, unclean, offering, covenant
‚Ä¢ Literal historical statements: "we were slaves", "brought out of Egypt"
‚Ä¢ Straightforward descriptions: "good land", "evil generation", "great nation"
‚Ä¢ Literal geographic/physical descriptions
‚Ä¢ Standard biblical narrative language
‚Ä¢ Technical theological terminology
‚Ä¢ Procedural/instructional language using "as/like"

**NARRATIVE STATEMENTS - ALWAYS LITERAL:**
‚Ä¢ Character actions with literal agency: "serpent duped me" = LITERAL fact
‚Ä¢ Relationship descriptions: "enmity between you and woman" = LITERAL relationship
‚Ä¢ Physical appearance: "delight to the eyes" = LITERAL attractiveness
‚Ä¢ Factual character descriptions in narrative context

**EXTREMELY HIGH THRESHOLD FOR FIGURATIVE DETECTION:**
Only mark as figurative if there is CLEAR cross-domain comparison or obvious human traits given to non-human entities. When in doubt, classify as LITERAL.

üìã **METAPHOR vs PERSONIFICATION - SIMPLE RULES** üìã

**METAPHOR:** Compares two different kinds of things
‚Ä¢ "God is a shepherd" = God compared to pastoral role
‚Ä¢ "mighty hand of God" = divine power compared to human body part
‚Ä¢ Cross-domain comparisons where A is described as B

**PERSONIFICATION:** Gives human actions/qualities to non-human things
‚Ä¢ "shrewdest of beasts" = animal given human intelligence trait
‚Ä¢ "land spewed out inhabitants" = land given human action of vomiting
‚Ä¢ Non-human entities acting/feeling like humans

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- METAPHOR = X is like Y (comparison)
- PERSONIFICATION = non-human X does/feels human thing Y (attribution)

IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ‚Üí CLASSIFY AS LITERAL

‚úÖ **WHEN TO MARK AS FIGURATIVE - ONLY THESE:**

**CLEAR METAPHORS:**
‚Ä¢ Cross-domain comparisons: "God is shepherd" (divine ‚Üî pastoral)
‚Ä¢ Divine body parts: "mighty hand" (God has no literal body)
‚Ä¢ A is B statements where A and B are genuinely different categories

**CLEAR PERSONIFICATION:**
‚Ä¢ Non-human entities given human actions: "land vomited out inhabitants"
‚Ä¢ Divine emotions beyond standard actions: God angry, jealous, regretful
‚Ä¢ Abstract concepts acting as agents: Wisdom speaks, Death swallows

**CLEAR SIMILES:**
‚Ä¢ UNLIKE things compared with "like/as": "numerous as stars"
‚Ä¢ NOT procedural instructions or historical precedents

**ONLY MARK IF:**
1. CLEAR cross-domain transfer OR obvious human traits to non-human
2. Confidence > 0.7
3. NOT in the exclusion lists above
4. Would NOT be understood as literal by ancient readers

**SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION:**
For any figurative language found, use basic categories:
- Vehicle: "nature", "human", "divine", "abstract"
- Tenor: "God", "people", "nation", "covenant"
- Keep explanations short and clear

üîç **ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
- "Ritual and Worship" - for religious practices, ceremonial activities, and covenantal symbols

VEHICLE LEVEL 2 (Specific Domain):
THE NATURAL WORLD:
  - animal: characteristics/behavior of creatures (lion, eagle, sheep, etc.)
  - agricultural: farming, crops, livestock (vineyard, shepherd, harvest, etc.)
  - elemental: forces of nature (fire, wind, water, light, storm, etc.)
  - geological: earth features (rock, mountain, spring, foundation, etc.)
  - celestial: sky and heavenly bodies (stars, sun, moon, heaven, etc.)

HUMAN INSTITUTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS:
  - familial: direct family relationships (father, mother, brother, inheritance, etc.)
  - military: warfare, weapons (shield, sword, warrior, battle, conquest, etc.)
  - architectural: buildings, structures (fortress, refuge, tower, house, etc.)
  - political-legal: power, authority, leadership, judicial actions (king, judge, dominance, rule, etc.)
  - interpersonal: general human relationships and interactions (face to face, serve, etc.)
  - social-status: hierarchical position, social standing (head and tail, high above, treading on backs, etc.)

ABSTRACT AND INTERNAL STATES:
  - psychological-cognitive: mental states, thoughts, understanding (gain insight, harden heart, etc.)
  - moral-spiritual: sin, righteousness, wickedness (no-gods, treacherous breed, etc.)
  - temporal: time, duration (ancient, eternal, brief, seasons, etc.)
  - economic: trade, prosperity (wealth, poverty, lending, etc.)
  - industrial: craftsmanship, labor (refining, metalwork, etc.)

BODY AND ANATOMY:
  - anthropomorphic-divine: God's body parts representing power/presence (hand, arm, face, eyes, etc.)
  - human-body: human body parts for actions/emotions (heart for will, hand for action, etc.)

RITUAL AND WORSHIP:
  - sacrificial: offerings, ritual sacrifice imagery (in your nostrils, etc.)
  - priestly: ceremonial functions (Thummim and Urim, etc.)
  - covenantal: blessing, curse, covenant symbols and practices

TENOR CLASSIFICATION - Two-Level System:
These represent the major thematic domains of the Pentateuch:

TENOR LEVEL 1 (Broad Categories):
- "Divine-Human Relationship" - God's nature, character, actions; humanity/Israel's identity
- "Covenant & Its Consequences" - blessings for obedience, curses for disobedience

TENOR LEVEL 2 (Specific Subcategories):
DIVINE-HUMAN RELATIONSHIP:
  - Divine Sovereignty: God as Creator, ultimate ruler, judge, authority
  - Divine Presence: God's tangible manifestations, closeness, theophany
  - Divine Provision: God as sustainer, provider, deliverer, nurturer
  - Israel's Identity: Israel's unique covenantal status as YHWH's chosen people
  - Humanity's Status: general human nature, purpose, moral character
  - Moral & Spiritual State: internal spiritual/moral dispositions, heart/soul metaphors

COVENANT & ITS CONSEQUENCES:
  - Blessing: rewards of obedience - material prosperity, social elevation
  - Curse: consequences of disobedience - material destitution, humiliation, subjugation
  - Idolatry: false worship, spiritual adultery, no-gods
  - Wisdom & Discernment: understanding, foolishness, intellectual/spiritual insight

Example 4 - Idolatry Classification:
Hebrew: "sculptured image"
Analysis: [{{"type": "metaphor", "vehicle_level_1": "Abstract and Internal States", "vehicle_level_2": "moral-spiritual", "tenor_level_1": "Covenant & Its Consequences", "tenor_level_2": "Idolatry", "explanation": "False worship imagery representing spiritual corruption"}}]

Example 5 - Moral/Spiritual State:
Hebrew: "harden your heart"
Analysis: [{{"type": "metaphor", "vehicle_level_1": "Abstract and Internal States", "vehicle_level_2": "psychological-cognitive", "tenor_level_1": "Divine-Human Relationship", "tenor_level_2": "Moral & Spiritual State", "explanation": "Internal disposition metaphor for spiritual rebellion"}}]
