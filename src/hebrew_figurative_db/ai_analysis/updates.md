Of course! It's a great idea to summarize our progress for a handoff. We've made significant improvements to the stability, robustness, and usability of your project in this session.

Here is a list of all the work we've accomplished:

Project Enhancements and Bug Fixes
Robust API Rate-Limit Handling:

Diagnosed: Identified that 429 rate-limit errors from the Gemini API were causing silent failures and zero-result outputs.
Implemented: Added a sophisticated retry mechanism to the MultiModelGeminiClient that intelligently parses the retry_delay from the API's error message, ensuring the script waits the correct amount of time before retrying.
Secure and Convenient API Key Management:

Implemented: Migrated from hardcoded API keys and temporary environment variables to a secure and standard .env file system.
Enhanced: The main script now automatically loads the GEMINI_API_KEY from the .env file at startup, improving both convenience and security.
Data Integrity and Sanitization:

Diagnosed: Uncovered and fixed two critical data pipeline failures:
JSON Parsing Failure: The LLM's conversational responses were breaking the JSON parser.
Database Constraint Failure: The LLM was generating non-standard figurative language types (e.g., "irony"), which violated the database schema's CHECK constraint.
Architectural Fix: Implemented robust data sanitization logic directly within the gemini_api_multi_model.py client. The client now cleans the LLM's response, extracts the JSON, and sanitizes the type field before returning the data, ensuring that any script using the client receives clean, database-ready output.
Enhanced Script Functionality:

Granular Verse Selection: Updated the interactive_multi_model_processor.py script to allow users to analyze not just a full chapter, but also a single verse or a specific range of verses (e.g., "5-10").
Codebase Stability and Cleanup:

Resolved File State: Corrected issues caused by misapplied code changes by providing complete, clean, and final versions of interactive_multi_model_processor.py and gemini_api_multi_model.py.
Improved Debugging: Added clear startup messages to the interactive script to confirm whether the .env file was successfully located and loaded, making future troubleshooting easier.
In short, we've transformed the processing scripts from brittle to resilient, secured the API credentials, and added valuable new features for more targeted analysis. The project is now in a much more stable and maintainable state for the next phase of development.
