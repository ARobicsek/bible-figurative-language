The New Subcategories
I've grouped the figurative language into more specific and descriptive categories based on the source of the imagery. This allows for a more nuanced and insightful analysis. Note these should now be subcategory level 1 and level 2 (e.g. The Natural World = level 1; animal = level 2)

The Natural World üåø
This category includes metaphors and similes that draw from plants, animals, and natural phenomena. It's a rich source of biblical imagery that connects divine action and human experience to the familiar world around us.

Animal: These similes and metaphors use animal behavior or characteristics to describe people, divine action, or abstract concepts.

Examples: "A stiffnecked people" (comparing stubbornness to a stiff-necked animal), "Dan is a lion's whelp" (comparing a tribe's strength to a young lion), "Like an eagle" (God's care compared to an eagle's).

Agricultural: This subcategory draws from farming, crops, and livestock. It's a powerful way to describe prosperity, divine judgment, and human effort.

Examples: "A land flowing with milk and honey," "The vine for them is from Sodom" (connecting moral corruption to a bitter plant), "he shall reap what he sows" (a concept that is often an extension of this type of metaphor).

Elemental: This focuses on forces of nature like fire, water, and air to describe divine power, judgment, or spiritual states.

Examples: "A consuming fire" (describing God's power), "like water" (describing the easy shedding of blood), "dark with densest clouds" (representing God's majesty and mystery).

Geological: This category uses imagery from rocks, earth, and mountains to convey ideas of stability, strength, or hardship.

Examples: "The Rock" (God as a source of steadfastness), "water from the flinty rock" (miraculous provision), "the earth under you iron" (symbolizing harshness and lack of sustenance).

Celestial: This category refers to the sky and heavenly bodies.

Examples: "as numerous as the stars" (a population count), "skies above your head shall be copper" (representing a lack of rain or divine favor).

Human Institutions and Relationships ü§ù
These categories use human social structures, roles, and relationships to explain the divine-human relationship and social dynamics.

Familial: These metaphors and similes use family relationships to describe the bond between God and Israel or among the Israelites.

Examples: "children of your God," "as a householder carries his son," "treasured people" (comparing the nation to a valuable possession).

Military: This imagery comes from warfare, weapons, and military strategy. It's a common way to describe God‚Äôs power and intervention, as well as human conflict.

Examples: "mighty hand and an outstretched arm" (divine power and protection), "a snare" (idolatry as a trap), "shock-troops" (describing a military vanguard).

Architectural: This draws from building, structures, and ruins. It's often used to describe stability, destruction, or the blessings of the land.

Examples: "great and flourishing cities" (divine blessing), "an everlasting ruin" (complete destruction), "a refuge" (God as a safe place).

Social/Political: This category includes metaphors from societal roles, governance, and national status.

Examples: "the head, not the tail" (dominance vs. subservience), "a ruthless nation" (attributing a hardened face to a people), "a base thought in your heart" (a moral failing).

Sensory: These metaphors relate to the five senses, particularly sight and touch. They describe perception, understanding, and knowledge.

Examples: "eyes to see" (spiritual insight), "groping at noon" (lack of clarity in a situation where it should be obvious), "a mind to understand."

Abstract and Internal States üß†
These categories classify metaphors and similes that describe internal, psychological, or abstract concepts.

Emotional: This group uses human emotions and mental states to describe divine characteristics or a people's spiritual condition.

Examples: "an impassioned God," "your heart turns away," "a despondent spirit."

Sickness/Medical: These metaphors use diseases, afflictions, and medical conditions to describe the spiritual state of a person or the consequences of disobedience.

Examples: "the dreadful diseases of Egypt," "a malignant and chronic disease," "sickness" (as a broader term for affliction).

Covenantal/Spiritual: This is a key category that describes the unique relationship between God and Israel. It includes legal, religious, and spiritual concepts.

Examples: "keeps the divine covenant," "the Rock of their support," "a foolish people" (lack of spiritual wisdom), "your God is your life."

Temporal: This category uses time or seasons to describe the duration, nature, or certainty of an event.

Examples: "length of your days," "as long as there is a heaven over the earth" (permanence), "day of disaster."

Economic/Industrial: This group uses imagery from trade, labor, and craftsmanship.

Examples: "an iron blast furnace" (harshness and oppression), "you will extend loans to many nations" (dominance through prosperity), "God will test you" (like a refiner tests metal).
