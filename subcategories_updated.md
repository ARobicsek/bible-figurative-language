I realized that in our categorization, we’re capturing information about the VEHICLE of the figurative speech but not the TENOR (the target). (For example, in the phrase “all the world’s a stage”, the world is the TENOR and the stage is the VEHICLE.)
So I’d like to make the following change. Let’s change subcategory_level_1 to vehicle_level_1, subcategory_level_2 to vehicle_level_2. And let’s add two levels for capturing the tenor (the target or subject of the figurative speech).
Tenor: Level 1 Categories
These broad categories represent the major thematic domains of the Pentateuch.
•	Divine-Human Relationship: This category encompasses all figurative language that describes the nature, character, and actions of God (YHWH), as well as the identity and responsibilities of humanity and Israel in relation to the divine. It is the central pillar of the Pentateuchal narrative, covering creation, covenant, and divine presence.
•	Covenant & Its Consequences: This category is dedicated to the outcomes of the covenantal relationship. It includes figurative expressions that describe the blessings promised for obedience and the curses and hardships that result from disobedience and rebellion. This is particularly prominent in the legal codes and the narrative of Israel's journey in the wilderness.
•	Communal & Moral Realities: This category captures the figurative language used to describe the internal and external state of the people. It includes metaphors about their moral character, social order, and their relationships with one another and with other nations. It addresses the lived experience of the community under the covenant.
