- **`אֵל עֶלְיוֹן` (God Most High):** I considered if the epithet `עֶלְיוֹן` ("Most High") could be a spatial metaphor, where physical height represents supreme status and power. However, I have excluded it. This term functions as a standard divine title in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East. The connection between height and supremacy is a "dead metaphor" so conventional that it is part of the standard lexicon for describing hierarchy, not a fresh figurative comparison. A conservative approach treats such established titles as non-figurative.

- **`אֲשֶׁר־מִגֵּן` (Who has delivered):** I considered the verb `מִגֵּן`, which is related to the noun `מָגֵן` ("shield"). This could suggest a figurative meaning like "to shield your enemies over to you." However, the established lexical meaning of the verb in this context is "to deliver" or "to hand over." Sticking to the primary meaning, the verb itself does not constitute figurative language.

- **`בְּיָדֶךָ` (into your hand):** I considered this phrase as a potential metaphor, metonymy, and idiom. I have included it as figurative. This is a classic biblical idiom where a physical body part, the "hand" (`יָד`), is used to represent an abstract concept: "power," "control," or "possession." This directly fits the instruction to mark physical concepts applied to abstract ones. It is a clear metonymy, where the instrument of power (the hand) stands for power itself. It is also based on a conceptual metaphor where CONTROL IS PHYSICAL POSSESSION. Although it is a very common idiom, its figurative origin and meaning are transparent.

- **`מִכֹּל` (of everything):** I considered if this might be hyperbole, as Abram gave a tenth of the spoils of war, not a tenth of literally "everything" in existence or that he owned. I have excluded it. In narrative context, `כֹּל` ("all" or "everything") is a standard way to refer to the entirety of a specific, implied set of goods (in this case, the spoils). It functions as a summary statement, not a deliberate exaggeration for rhetorical effect.
